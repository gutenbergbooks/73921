<p>“The reform that applies itself to the household must not be
partial. It must correct the whole system of our social living.
It must come with plain living and high thinking; it must break
up caste, and put domestic service on another foundation. It
must come in connection with a true acceptance by each man of
his vocation,—not chosen by his parents or friends, but by his
genius, with earnestness and love.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

</div>

<p>The basis of the following discussion of the subject of
domestic service is the information obtained through a
series of blanks sent out during the years 1889 and 1890.
Three schedules were prepared—one for employers, one
for employees, and one asking for miscellaneous information
in regard to the Woman’s Exchange, the teaching of
household employments, and kindred subjects.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> These
schedules were submitted for criticism to several gentlemen
prominent in statistical investigation, and after
revision five thousand sets were distributed. These were
sent out in packages containing from five to twenty-five
sets through the members of the Classes of 1888 and 1889,
Vassar College, and single sets were mailed, with a statement
of the object of the work, to the members of different
associations presumably interested in such investigations.
These were the American Statistical Association, the
American Economic Association, the Association of Collegiate
Alumnæ, the Vassar Alumnæ, and the women
graduates of the University of Michigan. They were
also sent to various women’s clubs, and many were distributed
at the request of persons interested in the work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span></p>

<p>Of the five thousand sets of blanks thus sent out, 1025
were returned filled out by employers, twenty being
received after the tabulation was completed. These gave
the facts asked for with reference to 2545 employees. The
returns received from employers thus bore about the same
proportion to the blanks distributed as do the returns
received in ordinary statistical investigation carried on
without the aid of special agents or legal authority. The
reasons why a larger number were not returned are the
same as are found in all such inquiries, with a few peculiar
to the nature of the case. The occupation investigated
is one that does not bring either employer or employee
into immediate contact with others in the same
occupation, and it is therefore believed that the relations
between employer and employee are purely personal, and
thus not a proper subject for statistical inquiry. Another
reason assigned was the fear that the agitation of the
subject would cause employees to become dissatisfied,
while a third reason was the large number of questions
included in the blanks, and the fact that no immediate
and possibly no remote benefit would accrue to those
filling them out. Another reason frequently assigned
was that all of the questions could not be answered, and
that, therefore, replies to others could not be of service.
Several of the questions, however, were framed with the
understanding that in many cases they could not be definitely
answered; as the question, “How many servants
have you employed since you have been housekeeping?”
The fact that often no reply could be given, was as significant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span>
of the condition of the service as a detailed statement
could have been.</p>

<p>No success had been anticipated in securing replies
from employees; but as any study of domestic service
would be incomplete without looking at it from this point
of view, the attempt was made. As a result, 719 blanks
were returned filled out. In some instances employees,
hearing of the inquiry, wrote for schedules and returned
them answered. In a few cases correspondence was carried
on with women who had formerly been in domestic
service. The influences that operated to prevent employers
from answering the inquiries made had even greater
force in the case of employees. In addition, there was
present a hesitation to commit anything to writing, or to
sign a name to a document the import of which was not
clearly understood by them.</p>

<p>The limited amount of information that could be given
explains the small number of returns received to the third
schedule,—about two hundred.</p>

<p>The returns received were sent to the Massachusetts
Bureau of Statistics of Labor, where, by the courtesy of
the chief of the bureau, they were collated during the
spring and summer of 1890, under the special direction of
the chief clerk, in accordance with a previously arranged
scheme of tables. The general plan of arrangement
adopted was to class the schedules with reference to employers,
first alphabetically by states and towns, and
second alphabetically by population. The schedules were
then classed with reference to employees, first by men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
and women, and second by place of birth. The various
statistical devices used in the Massachusetts Bureau were
employed in tabulating the material, and greatly facilitated
the work.</p>

<p>Fifty large tables were thus prepared, and by various
combinations numerous smaller ones were made. The
classification thus adopted made it possible to give all the
results either in a general form or with special reference
to men and women employees, the native born and the
foreign born, and to all of the branches of the service.
It was also possible to study the conditions of the service
geographically, and with reference to the population and
to other industrial situations.</p>

<p>The most detailed tables made out concerned the wage
question, including a presentation of classified wages,
average wages with the percentage of employees receiving
the same wages as the average, and also more or less
than the average, a comparison of wages paid at different
times and of wages received in domestic service and in
other employments. For the purposes of comparison,
the writer also classified the salaries paid to about six
thousand teachers in the public schools in sixteen representative
cities, as indicated by the reports of city
superintendents for the year during which information
concerning domestic service had been given on the schedules.
Through the courtesy of a large employment
bureau in Boston, the wages received by nearly three
thousand employees were ascertained and used for comparison.
The most valuable results of the investigation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
possibly were those growing out of the consensus of
opinion obtained from employers and employees regarding
the nature of the service considered as an occupation.
The greater proportion of these tables can be found in
Chapter V.</p>

<p>The question must naturally arise as to how far the
returns received through such investigation can be considered
representative. It has seemed to the writer that
they could be considered fairly so. Investigations of this
character must always be considered typical rather than
comprehensive. It is difficult to fix the exact number
to be considered typical as between a partial investigation
and a census which is exhaustive. In some cases
it is possible to obtain a majority in numbers, in others
it is not. If the number of returns, however, passes the
point where it would be considered trivial, the number
between this and the majority may perhaps be regarded
as representative. By the application of a similar principle,
the expression at the polls of the wishes of the
twentieth part of the inhabitants of a state is recognized
as the will of the majority. But, while the returns can
be considered only fairly representative as regards numbers,
they seem entirely so as regards conditions. It is
believed that every possible condition under which domestic
service exists, as regards both employer and employee,
is represented by the returns received, and that,
therefore, the conclusions drawn from these results cannot
be wholly unreasonable. Moreover, the circulars were
sent out practically at random, and, therefore, do not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span>
represent any particular class in society, except the class
sufficiently interested in the subject to answer the questions
asked. If the returns thus secured can be regarded
in any sense as representative, the results based on them
may be considered as indicating certain general conditions
and tendencies, although the conclusions reached
may be modified by later and fuller researches.</p>

<p>The question must also arise as to what it is hoped
will be accomplished through this investigation. It is
not expected that all, or even any one of the perplexing
questions connected with domestic service will be even
partially answered by it; it is not expected that any
individual housekeeper will have less trouble to-morrow
than to-day in adjusting the difficulties arising in her
household; it will not enable any employer whose incompetent
cook leaves to-day without warning to secure
an efficient one without delay. It is hoped, however, that
the tabulation and presentation of the facts will afford
a broader basis for general discussion that has been possible
without them, that a knowledge of the conditions
of domestic service beyond their own localities and households
will enable some housekeepers in time to decide
more easily the economic questions arising within every
home, that it will do a little something to stimulate discussion
of the subject on other bases than the purely
personal one. The hope has also come that writers on
economic theory and economic conditions will recognize
the place of domestic service among other industries, and
will give to the public the results of their scientific<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
investigations of the subject, that the great bureaus of
labor—always ready to anticipate any demand of the
public—will recognize a demand for facts in this field
of work.</p>

<p>The writer has followed the presentation of facts by
a theoretical discussion of doubtful and possible remedies.
But if fuller and more searching official investigation,
establishing a substantial basis for discussion, should
point to conclusions entirely at variance with those here
given, no one would more heartily rejoice than herself.
It may reasonably be said that in view of the character of
the investigation no conclusions at all should have been
advanced by the investigator. Three things, however,
seemed to justify the intrusion of personal views; a recognition
of the prevalent anxiety to find a way out of existing
difficulties, a belief that improvement can come only
as each one is willing to make some contribution to the
general discussion, and a conviction that no one should
criticise existing conditions unless prepared to suggest
others that may be substituted for them.</p>

<p>The following discussion would have been impossible
without the hearty co-operation of the thousand and
more employers and the seven hundred employees who
filled out the schedules distributed. The great majority
of these were personally unknown to the writer, and she
can express only in this public way her deep appreciation
of their kindness, as she also wishes to do to the many
friends, known and unknown, who assisted in distributing
the schedules. She also desires to express her obligation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span>
to the Hon. Carroll D. Wright, for help received
in preparing the schedules and for the receipt of advance
sheets from the Census of 1890; to the Hon. Horace G.
Wadlin and Mr. Charles F. Pidgin, for the courtesies
extended at the Massachusetts Bureau of Statistics of
Labor, and also to Professor Davis R. Dewey, of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology; to Dean Marion
Talbot of the University of Chicago, and to Professor Mary
Roberts Smith, of the Leland Stanford Junior University;
to Mrs. John Wilkinson of Chicago, Mrs. John H. Converse
of Philadelphia, and Mrs. Helen Hiscock Backus of
Brooklyn, for their constant encouragement and assistance
in the work. Most of all the writer is under obligation
to Miss A. Underhill for her assistance in reading
both the manuscript and the proof of the work, and for
the preparation of the Index.</p>

<p>Articles bearing on the subject have at different times
appeared in the <i>Papers of the American Statistical Association</i>,
<i>The New England Magazine</i>, <i>The Cosmopolitan</i>,
and <i>The Forum</i>. These have been freely used in the
work, and the writer acknowledges the courtesy of the
publishers and editors of these periodicals in allowing
this use of her papers.</p>

<p>It has seemed advisable in sending out a second edition
of this work to add a supplementary chapter on the condition
of domestic service in Europe. This is based
largely on the inquiries made in season and out of season
at different times during the past ten years of heads of
households and of housekeepers in England, France, Germany,
and Italy. It has naturally been impossible to
sum up in a single chapter the mass of information thus
gleaned, but a few features common to all of these
countries have been indicated, as well as some peculiar
to each. The literature bearing directly on the subject
is very meagre, but a few titles have been indicated.</p>

<p>For information bearing on this part of the work, I am
under special obligation to M. Levasseur of Paris, to Miss
Collet of the Labor Department of the Board of Trade,
London, to Miss E. M. Hall of Rome, to Professor Victor
Böhmert, recently of the Royal Statistical Bureau, Dresden,
and to Mrs. J. H. W. Stuckenberg of Cambridge,
recently of Berlin.</p>

<h1>DOMESTIC SERVICE</h1>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br>
<span class="smaller">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Domestic service has been called “the great American
question.” If based on the frequency of its discussion in
popular literature, foundation for this judgment exists.
Few subjects have attracted greater attention, but its
consideration has been confined to four general classes of
periodicals, each treating it from a different point of view.
The popular magazine article is theoretical in character,
and often proposes remedies for existing evils without
sufficient consideration of the causes of the difficulty.
Household journals and the home departments of the
secular and the religious press usually treat only of the
personal relations existing between mistress and maid.
The columns of the daily press given to “occasional correspondents”
contain narrations of personal experiences.
The humorous columns of the daily and the illustrated
weekly papers caricature, on the one side, the ignorance
and helplessness of the housekeeper, and, on the other
side, the insolence and presumption of the servant. In
addition to this, in many localities it has passed into a
common proverb that, among housekeepers, with whatever
topic conversation begins, it sooner or later gravitates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
towards the one fixed point of domestic service, while
among domestic employees it is none the less certain
that other phases of the same general subject are
agitated.</p>

<p>This popular discussion, which has assumed so many
forms, has been almost exclusively personal in character.
A somewhat different aspect of the case is presented
when the problem is stated to be “as momentous as that
of capital and labor, and as complicated as that of individualism
and socialism.” This statement suggests that
economic principles are involved, but the question of domestic
service has been almost entirely omitted, not without
reason, from theoretical, statistical, and historical
discussions of economic problems. It has been omitted
from theoretical discussions mainly because: (1) the
occupation does not involve the investment of a large
amount of capital on the part of the individual employer
or employee; it therefore seems to be excluded from
theoretical discussions of the relations of capital, wages,
and labor; (2) no combinations have yet been formed
among employers or employees; it is therefore exempt
from such speculations as are involved in the consideration
of trusts, monopolies, and trade unions; (3) the
products of domestic service are more transient than
are the results of other forms of labor; this fact must
determine somewhat its relative position in economic discussion.
Its exclusion, as a rule, from the statistical presentations
of the labor question is also not surprising.
The various bureaus of labor, both national and state,
consider only those subjects for the investigation of which
there is a recognized demand. They are the leaders of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
public opinion in the accumulation of facts, but they are
its followers as regards the choice of questions to be
studied. Public opinion has not yet demanded a scientific
treatise on domestic service, and until it does the
bureaus of labor cannot be expected to supply the material
for such discussion.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Again, it is not surprising that
the historical side of the subject has been overlooked,
since household employments have been passive recipients,
not active participants, in the industrial development
of the past century. Yet it must be said that this
negative consideration of the subject by theoretical, practical,
and historical economists, and the positive treatment
accorded it by popular writers, seems an unfair and unscientific
disposition to make of an occupation in which
by the Census of 1890 one and a half millions of persons
are actively engaged,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> to whom employers pay annually
at the lowest rough estimate in cash wages more than
$218,000,000,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> for whose support they pay at the lowest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
estimate an equal amount,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and through whose hands
passes so large a part of the finished products of other
forms of labor.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>It is not difficult, however, to find reasons, in addition
to the specific ones suggested, for this somewhat cavalier
treatment of domestic service. The nature of the service
rendered, as well as the relation between employer and
employee, is largely personal; it is believed therefore that
all questions involved in the subject can be considered
and settled from the personal point of view. It follows
from this fact that it is extremely difficult to ascertain
the actual condition of the service outside of a single
family, or, at best, a locality very narrow in extent, and
therefore that it is almost impossible to treat the subject
in a comprehensive manner. It follows as a result of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
two previous reasons that domestic service has never been
considered a part of the great labor question, and that it
has not been supposed to be affected by the political,
social, and industrial development of the past century as
other occupations have been.</p>

<p>These various explanations of the failure to consider
domestic service in connection with other forms of labor
are in reality but different phases of a fundamental reason—the
isolation that has always attended household service
and household employments. From the fact that
other occupations are largely the result of association and
combination they court investigation and the fullest and
freest discussion of their underlying principles and their
influence on each other. Household service, since it is
based on the principle of isolation, is regarded as an affair
of the individual with which the public at large has no
concern. Other forms of industry are anxious to call to
their assistance all the legislative, administrative, and judicial
powers of the nation, all the forces that religion,
philanthropy, society itself can exert in their behalf. The
great majority of housekeepers, if the correspondent of a
leading journal is to be trusted, “do not require outside
assistance in the management of their affairs, and consequently
resent any interference in the administration of
their duties.”</p>

<p>The question must arise, however, in view of the interdependence
of all other forms of industry, whether it is
possible to maintain this perfect separation with regard
to any one employment, whether household employments
are justified in resenting any intrusion into their domain,
whether the individual employer is right in considering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
household service exclusively a personal affair. An answer
to the question may be of help in deciding whether
the difficulties that are found in the present system of
domestic service arise in every case necessarily from the
personal relations which exist between employer and employee,
or are largely due to economic conditions over
which the individual employer has no control. Still further,
the conclusions reached must determine somewhat
the nature of the forces to be set in motion to lessen these
difficulties.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br>
<span class="smaller">HISTORICAL ASPECTS OF DOMESTIC EMPLOYMENTS</span></h2>

</div>

<p>It is impossible to understand the condition of domestic
service as it exists to-day without a cursory glance at the
changes in household employments resulting from the
inventions of the latter part of the eighteenth century.
These changes, unlike many others, came apparently
without warning. At the middle of the last century
steam was a plaything, electricity a curiosity of the laboratory,
and wind and water the only known motive
powers. From time immemorial the human hand unaided,
except by the simplest machinery, had clothed the world.
Iron could be smelted only with wood, and the English
parliament had seriously discussed the suppression of the
iron trade as the only means of preserving the forests.
But during the last third of the century the brilliant
inventions of Hargreaves, Arkwright, Crompton, and
Cartwright had made possible the revolutionizing of all
forms of cotton and woollen industries; Watt had given a
new motive power to the world; the uses of coal had
been multiplied, and soon after its mining rendered safe;
while a thousand supplementary inventions had followed
quickly in the train of these. A new era of inventive
genius had dawned, which was to rival in importance that
of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>The immediate result of these inventions was seen in
the rapid transference of all the processes of cotton and
woollen manufactures from the home of the individual
weaver and spinner to large industrial centres, the centralization
of important interests in the hands of a few,
and a division of labor that multiplied indefinitely the
results previously accomplished.</p>

<p>But the factory system of manufactures that superseded
the domestic system of previous generations has not been
the product of inventions alone. It has been pointed out
by Mr. Carroll D. Wright<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> that while these inventions
have been the material forces through which the change
was accomplished, other agencies co-operated with them.
These co-operating influences have been physical, as illustrated
in the discoveries of Watt; philosophical, as seen
in the works of Adam Smith; commercial, or the industrial
supremacy of England considered as a result of the
loss of the American colonies; and philanthropical, or
those connected with the work of the Wesleys, John
Howard, Hannah More, and Wilberforce. All these acting
in conjunction with the material force—invention—have
operated on manufacturing industries to produce
the factory system of to-day. It is, indeed, because the
factory system is the resultant of so many forces working
in the past that it touches in the present nearly every
great economic, social, political, moral, and philanthropic
question.</p>

<p>Although comparatively few of these inventions have
been intended primarily to lessen household labor, this
era of inventive activity has not been without its effects<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
on household employments. A hundred years ago the
household occupations carried on in the average family
included, in addition to whatever is now ordinarily done,
every form of spinning and weaving cotton, wool and
flax, carpet weaving and making, upholstering, knitting,
tailoring, the making of boots, shoes, hats, gloves, collars,
cuffs, men’s underclothing, quilts, comfortables, mattresses,
and pillows; also, the making of soap, starch, candles,
yeast, perfumes, medicines, liniments, crackers, cheese,
coffee-browning, the drying of fruits and vegetables, and
salting and pickling meat. Every article in this list,
which might be lengthened, can now be made or prepared
for use out of the house of the consumer, not only better
but more cheaply by the concentration of capital and
labor in large industrial enterprises. Moreover, as a result
of other forms of inventive genius, the so-called modern
improvements have taken out of the ordinary household
many forms of hard and disagreeable labor. The use of
kerosene, gas, natural gas, and electricity<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> for all purposes
of lighting, and to a certain extent for heating and cooking;
the adoption of steam-cleaning for furniture and
wearing apparel; the invention of the sewing-machine
and other labor-saving contrivances; the improvement of
city and village water-works, plumbing, heat-supplying
companies, city and village sanitation measures, including
the collection of ashes and garbage,—these are all the
results of modern business enterprise.</p>

<p>These facts are familiar, but the effects more easily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
escape notice. The change from individual to collective
enterprises, from the domestic to the factory system, has
released a vast amount of labor formerly done within the
house by women with three results: either this labour has
been diverted to other places, or into other channels, or
has become idle. The tendency at first was for labor
thus released to be diverted to other places. The home
spinners and weavers became the spinners and weavers in
factories, and later the home workers in other lines became
the operatives in other large establishments. As machinery
became more simple, women were employed in larger
numbers, until now, in several places and in several occupations,
their numbers exceed those of men employees.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
This fact has materially changed the condition of affairs
within the household. Under the domestic system of
manufactures nearly all women spent part of their time in
their own homes in spinning, weaving, and the making
of various articles of food and clothing in connection with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
their more active household duties. When women came
to be employed in factories, the division of labor made
necessary a readjustment of work so that housekeeping
duties were performed by one person giving all her time
to them instead of by several persons each giving a part
of her time. The tendency of this was at first naturally
to decrease the number of women partially employed in
household duties, and to increase the demand for women
giving all their time to domestic work.</p>

<p>This readjustment of work in the home and in the factory
brought also certain other changes that have an important
bearing. The first employees were the daughters
of farmers, tradesmen, teachers, and professional men of
limited means, women of sturdy, energetic New England
character. They were women who, in their own homes,
had been the spinners and the weavers for the family and
who had sometimes eked out a slender income by doing
the same work in their homes for others disqualified for
it. As machinery was simplified, and new occupations
more complex in character were opened to women, their
places were taken in factories by Irish immigrants as these
in turn have been displaced by the French Canadians.
All these changes in the personnel of factory operatives
have meant that while much labor has been taken out of
the household, that which remained has been performed
by fewer hands, and also that women of foreign nationalities
have been pressed into household service.</p>

<p>Another and later result of the change from the domestic
to the factory system was the diversion of much of the
labor at first performed within the household into entirely
different channels. The anti-slavery agitation beginning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
about 1830 enlisted the energies of many women, and the
discussions growing out of it were undoubtedly the occasion
for the opening of entirely new occupations to them.
Oberlin College was founded in 1833 and Mount Holyoke
Seminary in 1837, thus forming the entering wedge for
the entrance of women into higher educational work.
Medical schools for women were organized and professional
life made possible, while business interests began to
attract the attention of many.</p>

<p>Another part of the labor released by mechanical inventions
and labor-saving contrivances became in time idle
labor. By idle labor is meant not only absolute idleness,
but labor which is unproductive and adds neither to the
comfort nor to the intelligence of society. Work that had
previously been performed within the home without money
remuneration came to be considered unworthy of the same
women when performed for persons outside their own household
and for a fixed compensation. The era of so-called
fancy-work, which includes all forms of work in hair, wax,
leather, beads, rice, feathers, cardboard, and canvas, so
offensive to the artistic sense of to-day, was one product
of this labor released from necessary productive processes.
It was a necessary result because some outlet was needed
for the energies of women, society as yet demanded that
this outlet should be within the household, and the mechanical
instincts were strong while the artistic sense had not
been developed. It is an era not to be looked upon with
derision, but as an interesting phase in the history of the
evolution of woman’s occupation.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>Still another channel for this idle labor was found in
what has been called “intellectual fancy-work.” Literary
clubs and classes sprang up and multiplied, affording occupation
to their members, but producing nothing and
giving at first only the semblance of education and culture.
Many of them became in time a stimulus for more thorough
systematic work, but in their origin they were often
but a manifestation of aimless activity, of labor released
from productive channels.</p>

<p>The era of inventions and resulting business activity
has therefore changed materially the condition of affairs
within the household. Before this time all women shared
in preparing and cooking food; they spun, wove, and
made the clothing, and were domestic manufacturers in
the sense that they changed the raw material into forms
suitable for consumption. But modern inventions and
the resulting change in the system of manufactures, as
has been seen, necessarily affected household employments.
The change has been the same in kind, though
not in degree, as has come in the occupations of men.
In the last analysis every man is a tiller of the soil, but
division of labor has left only a small proportion of men
in this employment. So in the last analysis every woman
is a housekeeper who “does her own work,” but division
of labor has come into the household as well as into the
field, though in a more imperfect form. It has left many
women in the upper and middle classes unemployed,
while many in the lower classes are too heavily burdened;
in three of the four great industries which absorb<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
the energies of the majority of women working for remuneration—manufacturing,
work in shops, and teaching—the
supply of workers is greater than the demand, while
in the fourth—domestic service—the reverse is the case.
But it cannot be assumed that all of those in the first
three classes have necessarily been taken from the fourth
class. It has been well said that “through the introduction
of machinery, ignorant labor is utilized, not
created.” Many who under the old order would have
been able to live only under the most primitive conditions,
and whose labor can be used under the new order
only in the simplest forms of manufacturing, would be
entirely unfit to have the care of an ordinary household
in its present complex form.</p>

<p>One more effect must be noted of this transference of
many forms of household labor to large centres through
the operation of inventive genius. It has been seen that
many women have thus been left comparatively free from
the necessity of labor. The pernicious theory has therefore
grown up that women who are rich or well-to-do
ought not to work, at least for compensation, since by
so doing they crowd out of remunerative employment
others who need it. It is a theory that overlooks the
historical fact that every person should be in the last
analysis a producer, it is based wholly on the assumption
that work is a curse and not a blessing, and it does not
take into consideration the fact that every woman who
works without remuneration, or for less than the market
rates, thereby lowers the wages of every person who is a
breadwinner. It is a theory which if applied to men
engaged in business occupations would check all industrial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
progress. It is equally a hindrance when applied
to women.</p>

<p>This revolutionizing of manufacturing processes through
the substitution of the factory for the domestic system has
thus rendered necessary a shifting of all forms of household
labor. The division of labor here is but partially
accomplished, and out of this fact arises a part of the
friction that is found in household service.</p>

<p>Household employers and employees may be indifferent
to the changes that the industrial revolutions of a century
have brought, they may be ignorant of them all, but they
have not been unaffected by them, nor can they remain
unaffected by changes that may subsequently come in the
industrial system. The interdependence of all forms of
industry is so complete, that a change cannot revolutionize
one without in time revolutionizing all. The old
industrial régime cannot be restored, nor can household
employments of to-day be put back to their condition of a
hundred years ago.</p>

<span class="smaller">DOMESTIC SERVICE DURING THE COLONIAL PERIOD</span></h2>

</div>

<p>It has been seen how great a change the inventions of
the past century have made in the character of household
employments. A change in the nature of household service
no less important has taken place by virtue of the
political revolutions of the century, acting in connection
with certain economic and social forces. The subject of
domestic service looms up so prominently in the foreground
to-day that there is danger of forgetting that it
has a past as well as a present. Yet it is impossible to
understand its present condition without comprehending,
in a measure, the manner in which it has been affected by
its own history. It is equally impossible to forecast its
future without due regard to this history.</p>

<p>Domestic service in America has passed through three
distinct phases. The first extends from the early colonization
to the time of the Revolution; the second, from
the Revolution to about 1850; the third, from 1850 to
the present time.</p>

<p>During the colonial period service of every kind was
performed by transported convicts, indented white servants
or “redemptioners,” “free willers,” negroes, and
Indians.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p>The first three classes—convicts, redemptioners, and
free willers—were of European, at first generally of
English, birth. The colonization of the new world gave
opportunity for the transportation and subsequent employment
in the colonies of large numbers of persons who,
as a rule, belonged to a low class in the social scale.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The
mother country looked with satisfaction on this method
of disposing of those “such, as had there been no <i>English</i>
foreign Plantation in the World, could probably never
have lived at home to do service for their Country, but
must have come to be hanged, or starved, or dyed untimely
of some of those miserable Diseases, that proceed
from want, and vice.”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> She regarded her “plantations
abroad as a good effect proceeding from many evil
causes,” and congratulated herself on being freed from
“such sort of people, as their crimes and debaucheries
would quickly destroy at home, or whom their wants
would confine in prisons or force to beg, and so render
them useless, and consequently a burthen to the public.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>From the very first the advantage to England of this
method of disposing of her undesirable population had
been urged. The author of <i>Nova Britannia</i> wrote in
1609: “You see it no new thing, but most profitable for
our State, to rid our multitudes of such as lie at home,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
pestering the land with pestilence and penury, and infecting
one another with vice and villanie, worse than the
plague it selfe.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> So admirable did the plan seem in
time that between the years 1661 and 1668 various proposals
were made to the King and Council to constitute
an office for transporting to the Plantations all vagrants,
rogues, and idle persons that could give no account of
themselves, felons who had the benefit of clergy, and such
as were convicted of petty larceny—such persons to be
transported to the nearest seaport and to serve four years
if over twenty years of age, and seven years if under
twenty.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Virginia and Maryland<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> were the colonies to
which the majority of these servants were sent, though
they were not unknown elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Protests were often made against this method of settlement,
both by the colonists themselves<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and by Englishmen,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
but it was long before the English government<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
abandoned the practice of transporting criminals to the
American colonies.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Of the three classes of white, or Christian servants, as
they were called to distinguish them from Indians and
negroes, the free willers were evidently found only in
Maryland. This class was considered even more unfortunate
than that of the indented servants or convicts.
They were received under the condition that they be
allowed a certain number of days in which to dispose of
themselves to the greatest advantage. But since servants
could be procured for a trifling consideration on
absolute terms, there was no disposition to take a class of
servants who wished to make their own terms. If they
did not succeed in making terms within a certain number
of days, they were sold to pay for their passage.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The
colonists saw very little difference between the transported
criminals and political prisoners, the free willers,
and the redemptioners who sold themselves into slavery,
and as between the two classes—redemptioners and convicted
felons—they at first considered the felons the more
profitable as their term of service was for seven years,
while that of the indented servants was for five years
only.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>It is impossible to state the proportion of servants belonging
to the two classes of transported convicts and
redemptioners, but the statement is apparently fair that
the redemptioners who sold themselves into service to
pay for the cost of their passage constituted by far the
larger proportion. These were found in all the colonies,
though more numerous in the Southern and Middle colonies
than in New England. In Virginia and Maryland
they outnumbered negro slaves until the latter part of
the seventeenth century.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> In Massachusetts, apprenticed
servants bound for a term of years were sold from ships
in Boston as late as 1730,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> while the general trade in
bound white servants lasted until the time of the Revolution,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
and in Pennsylvania even until this century.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The first redemptioners were naturally of English birth,
but after a time they were supplanted by those of other
nationalities, particularly by the Germans and Irish. As
early as 1718 there was a complaint of the Irish immigrants
in Massachusetts.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> In Connecticut “a parcel of Irish
servants, both men and women,” just imported from
Dublin, was advertised to be sold cheap in 1764.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
1783 large numbers of Irish and German redemptioners
entered Maryland, and a society was formed to assist the
Germans who could not speak English.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>It has been said that a great majority of the redemptioners
belonged at first to a low class in the social scale.
A considerable number, however, both men and women,
belonged to the respectable, even to the so-called upper
classes of society.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> They were sent over to prevent disadvantageous
marriages,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> to secure inheritances to other
members of a family,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> or to further some criminal scheme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>Many of these bond servants sold themselves into
servitude, others were disposed of through emigration
brokers,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and still others were kidnapped, being enticed
on shipboard by persons called “spirits.”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>The form of indenture was simple, and varied but
little in the different colonies. Stripped of its cumbersome
legal phraseology, it included the three main points
of time of service, the nature of the service to be performed,
although this was usually specified to be “in
any such service as his employer shall employ him,”
and the compensation to be given.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>It sometimes happened that servants came without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
indenture. In such cases the law expressly and definitely
fixed their status, though it was found extremely
difficult to decide upon a status that could be permanent.
Virginia, in particular, for a long time found it
impossible to pass a law free from objections, and its
experience will illustrate the difficulties encountered elsewhere.
An early law in Virginia provided that if a
servant came without indenture, he or she was to serve
four years if more than twenty years old, five years if
between twelve and twenty years of age, and seven years
if under twelve.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Subsequently it was provided that all
Irish servants without indenture should serve six years<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
if over sixteen and that all under sixteen should serve
until the age of twenty-four,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and this was again modified
into a provision requiring those above sixteen years
to serve four years and those under fifteen to serve
until twenty-one, the Court to be the judge of their
ages.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> It was soon found, however, that the term of
six years “carried with it both rigour and inconvenience”
and that thus many were discouraged from coming to
the country, and “the peopling of the country retarded.”
It was therefore enacted that in the future no servant
of any Christian nation coming without indenture should
serve longer than those of the same age born in the
country.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> But as the law was also made retroactive, it
was soon ordained that all aliens without indenture could
serve five years if above sixteen years of age and all
under that until they were twenty-four years old, “that
being the time lymitted by the laws of England.”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> This
arrangement was equally unsatisfactory, since it was found
that under it “a servant if adjudged never soe little under
sixteene yeares pays for that small tyme three yeares service,
and if he be adjudged more the master looseth the
like.” It was then resolved that if the person were adjudged
nineteen years or over he or she should serve five
years, and if under that age then as many years as he
should lack of being twenty-four.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> This provision was
apparently satisfactory, subsequent laws varying only in
minor provisions concerning the details of the Act.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p>The condition of the redemptioners seems to have been,
for the most part, an unenviable one. George Alsop, it
is true, writes in glowing terms of the advantages enjoyed
in Maryland:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For know,” he says, “That the Servants here in <i>Mary-land</i> of all
Colonies, distant or remote Plantations, have the least cause to complain,
either for strictness of Servitude, want of Provisions, or need
of Apparel: Five dayes and a half in the Summer weeks is the alotted
time that they work in; and for two months when the Sun predominates
in the highest pitch of his heat, they claim an antient and customary
Priviledge, to repose themselves three hours in the day within
the house, and this is undeniably granted to them that work in the
Fields.</p>

<p>“In the Winter time, which lasteth three months (viz.), <i>December</i>,
<i>January</i>, and <i>February</i>, they do little or no work or employment, save
cutting of wood to make good fires to sit by, unless their Ingenuity
will prompt them to hunt the Deer, or Bear, or recreate themselves
in Fowling, to slaughter the Swans, Geese, and Turkeys (which this
Country affords in a most plentiful manner): For every Servant has
a Gun, Powder and Shot allowed him, to sport him withall on all
Holidayes and leasurable times, if he be capable of using it, or be
willing to learn.”<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Hammond also says of Virginia:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Women are not (as is reported) put into the ground to
worke, but occupie such domestique employments and houswifery as
in <i>England</i>, that is dressing victuals, righting up the house, milking,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
imployed about dayries, washing, sowing, &amp;c. and both men and
women have times of recreations, as much or more than in any part
of the world besides.... And whereas it is rumoured that Servants
have no lodging other then on boards, or by the Fire side, it is contrary
to reason to believe it: First, as we are Christians; next as
people living under a law, which compels as well the Master as the
Servant to perform his duty; nor can true labour be either expected
or exacted without sufficient cloathing, diet, and lodging; all which
both their Indentures (which must inviolably be observed) and the
Justice of the Country requires.”<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

</div>

<p>A Glasgow merchant under date of January 19, 1714,
also writes: “The servants are all well cloathed and provided
with bedding as ye will see,” adding that some
servants prefer “Mariland, the reason whereof is that
Virginia is a little odious to the people here.”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>But these enthusiastic descriptions must be taken <i>cum
grano salis</i>. The object of Alsop’s book was to stimulate
emigration to Maryland, as is evident from the dedication
to Lord Baltimore and to “all the Merchant Adventures
for Mary-land.” The object of <i>Leah and Rachel</i> was the
same, and others who wrote in a similar strain had evidently
little personal knowledge of the condition of the
redemptioners. The real life is more truly portrayed in
the accounts given by the redemptioners themselves, and
many of these are preserved.</p>

<p>The Anglesea Peerage Trial brings out the facts that
the redemptioners fared ill, worked hard, lived on a
coarse diet, and drank only water sweetened with a little
molasses and flavored with ginger.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Eddis says the
redemptioners were treated worse than the negroes, since
the loss of a negro fell on his master; inflexible severity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
was exercised over the European servants who “groaned
beneath a worse than Egyptian bondage.”<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Richard Frethorne, writing from Martin’s Hundred,
gives a pitiful tale of the sufferings of the indented
servants. “Oh! that you did see my daily and hourly
sighs, groans, tears and thumps that I afford my own
breast, and rue and curse the time of my birth with holy
Job. I thought no head had been able to hold so much
water as hath, and doth daily flow from mine eyes.”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>The maid who waited on the Sot-Weed Factor says:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Undoubtedly, in time, servants of all kinds received
more consideration than had at first been given them;<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
in 1704 Madame Knight even complained of what she
considered too great indulgence on the part of the Connecticut
farmers towards their slaves.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Yet, even at the
North, the lot of a servant was not an enviable one, though
much was done by the laws of all the colonies to mitigate
the condition of the redemptioners, as will be seen later in
discussing the legal relations of masters and servants.</p>

<p>The wages paid were, as a rule, small, though some
complaints are found, especially in New England, of high
wages and poor service.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> More often the wages were a
mere pittance. Elizabeth Evans came from Ireland to
serve John Wheelwright for three years. Her wages
were to be three pounds a year and passage paid.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
Margery Batman, after five years of service in Charlestown,
was to receive a she-goat to help her in starting
life.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Mary Polly, according to the terms of her indenture,
was to serve ten years and then receive “three
barrells of corn and one suit of penistone and one suit of
good serge with one black hood, two shifts of dowlas and
shoes and hose convenient.”<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>Peter Kalm writes of Pennsylvania in 1748: “A
servant maid gets eight or ten pounds a year: these
servants have their food besides their wages, but must
buy their own clothes, and what they get of these they
must thank their master’s goodness for.” He adds that
it was cheaper to buy indented servants since “this kind
of servants may be got for half the money, and even
for less; for they commonly pay fourteen pounds <i>Pennsylvania</i>
currency, for a person who is to serve four
years.”<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Even at the beginning of the present century
wages had scarcely risen. Samuel Breck writes of two
redemptioners whom he purchased in 1817: “I gave
for the woman seventy-six dollars, which is her passage-money,
with a promise of twenty dollars at the end of
three years if she serves me faithfully; clothing and maintenance
of course. The boy had paid twenty-six guilders
toward his passage-money, which I agreed to give him at
the end of three years; in addition to which I paid fifty-three
dollars and sixty cents for his passage, and for two
years he is to have six weeks’ schooling each year.”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>For the protection of both masters and servants the
law sometimes interfered and attempted to regulate the
matter of wages received at the end of an indenture.
In Virginia by the code of 1705 every woman servant
was to receive fifteen bushels of Indian corn and forty
shillings in money, or the value thereof in goods.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> In
1748 it was enacted “that every servant, male or female,
not having wages, shall, at the expiration of his, or her
time of service, have and receive three pounds ten shillings
current money, for freedom dues, to be paid by his,
or her master, or owner,”<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> and in 1758 the same law was
re-enacted, but excepting convicts from the provisions of
the Act.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> In South Carolina all women servants at the
expiration of their time were to have “a Wastcoat and
Petticoat of new Half-thick or Pennistone, a new Shift
of white Linnen, a new Pair of shoes and stockings, a
blue apron and two caps of white Linnen.”<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> The laws
of Pennsylvania provided that every servant who served
faithfully four years should at the expiration of the
term of servitude have a discharge and be duly clothed
with two complete suits of apparel, one of which should
be new,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> while in Massachusetts and New York it was
provided that all servants who had served diligently and
faithfully to the benefit of their masters should not be
sent away empty.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> In North Carolina every servant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
not having yearly wages was to be allowed at the expiration
of the term of service three pounds Proclamation
money, besides one sufficient suit of wearing clothes.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
In East New Jersey the law was more liberal and gave
every servant two suits of apparel suitable for a servant,
one good felling axe, a good hoe, and seven bushels of
good Indian corn.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> West New Jersey gave ten bushels
of corn, necessary apparel, two horses, and one axe.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> In
Maryland a woman at the expiration of her term was to
have the same provision of corn and clothes as men servants,
namely, “a good Cloath suite either of Kersey or
broad Cloath, a shift of white Linnen to be new, one
new pair of shoes and stockings, two hoes one Ax and
three barrˡˡˢ of Indian corn.”<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> A later act specified that
women servants were to have “a Waist-coat and Petty-coat
of new Half-thick, or Pennistone, a new Shift of
White Linen, Shoes and Stockings, a blue Apron, Two
Caps of White Linen, and Three Barrells of Indian
Corn.”<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>The test question to be applied to any system of service
is—Is the service secured through it satisfactory?
It has been seen that a considerable number of servants
could be secured through the system of indenture, though
probably less than the colonists desired, and that the
wages paid them were, as a rule, remarkably low. But
it must be said that the service received from indented
servants was, as a rule, what might be expected from
the class that came to America in that capacity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>It is easy to surmise the character of the service rendered
at first in Virginia and the difficulties encountered
by employers. Many of the redemptioners had been
idlers and vagabonds, and for idlers and vagabonds, there
as elsewhere, stringent laws were necessary. In 1610,
under the administration of Sir Thomas Gates, various
orders were passed with reference to pilfering on the
part of launderers, laundresses, bakers, cooks, and dressers
of fish.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“What man or woman soeuer, Laundrer or Laundresse appointed
to wash the foule linnen of any one labourer or souldier, or any one
else as it is their duties so to doe, performing little, or no other seruice
for their allowance out of the store, and daily prouisions, and
supply of other necessaries, vnto the Colonie, and shall from the
said labourer or souldier, or any one else, of what qualitie whatsoeuer,
either take any thing for washing, or withhold or steale from him any
such linnen committed to her charge to wash, or change the same
willingly and wittingly, with purpose to giue him worse, old or torne
linnen for his good, and proofe shall be made thereof, she shall be
whipped for the same, and lie in prison till she make restitution
of such linnen, withheld or changed.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Even more stringent penalties are attached to purloining
from the flour and meal given out for baking purposes.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>But it is not alone in Virginia that perplexed employers
were found. John Winter, writing to Trelawny from
Richmond Island, Maine, under date of July 10, 1639,
says of a certain Priscilla:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You write me of some yll reports is given of my Wyfe for beatinge
the maid; yf a faire waye will not do yt, beatinge must, sometimes,
vppon such Idlle girrells as she is. Yf you think yt fitte for
my wyfe to do all the worke &amp; the maide sitt still, she must forbeare
her hands to strike, for then the worke will ly vndonn. She hath bin
now 2 yeares ½ in the house, &amp; I do not thinke she hath risen 20 times
before my Wyfe hath bin vp to Call her, &amp; many tymes light the fire
before she Comes out of her bed. She hath twize gon a mechinge
in the woodes, which we haue bin faine to send all our Company to
seeke. We Cann hardly keep her within doores after we ar gonn to
beed, except we Carry the kay of the doore to beed with us. She
never Could melke Cow nor goat since she Came hither. Our men
do not desire to haue her boyle the kittle for them she is so sluttish.
She Cannot be trusted to serue a few piggs, but my wyfe most Commonly
must be with her. She hath written home, I heare, that she
was fame to ly vppon goates skins. She might take som goates skins
to ly in her bedd, but not given to her for her lodginge. For a yeare
&amp; quarter or more she lay with my daughter vppon a good feather
bed before my daughter being lacke 3 or 4 daies to Sacco, the maid
goes into beed with her Cloth &amp; stockins, &amp; would not take the paines
to plucke of her Cloths: her bedd after was a doust bedd &amp; she had 2
Coverletts to ly on her, but sheets she had none after that tyme she
was found to be so sluttish. Her beating that she hath had hath never
hurt her body nor limes. She is so fatt &amp; soggy she Cann hardly do
any worke. This I write all the Company will Justify. Yf this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
maid at her lasy tymes, when she hath bin found in her ill accyons,
do not deserue 2 or 3 blowes, I pray Judge You who hath most reason
to Complaine, my wyfe or the maid.... She hath an vnthankefull
office to do this she doth, for I thinke their was never that steward
yt amonge such people as we haue Could giue them all Content. Yt
does not pleas me well being she hath taken so much paines &amp; Care
to order things as well as she Could, &amp; ryse in the morning rath, &amp;
go to bed soe latte, &amp; to haue hard speches for yt.”<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Winter’s letters and reports to the London Company
are as full of his trials with his servants indoors and
out, as are the conferences to-day between perplexed employers.
Even when fortune smiled on him and one
promised well, misfortune overtook her.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The maid Tomson had a hard fortune. Yt was her Chance to be
drowned Cominge over the barr after our Cowes, &amp; very little water
on the barr, not aboue ½ foote, &amp; we Cannot Judge how yt should be,
accept that her hatt did blow from her head, &amp; she to saue her hatt
stept on the side of the barr.... I thinke yf she had lived she
would haue proved a good servant in the house: she would do more
worke then 3 such maides as Pryssyllea is.”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It is true that Maine was a remote colony and the difficulty
of obtaining good servants was presumably greater
than in places more accessible. Yet the same tale of trial
comes from Boston and from those whose means, character,
and position in society would seem to exempt them
from the difficulties more naturally to be expected in
other places. Mrs. Mary Winthrop Dudley writes repeatedly
in 1636 to her mother, Mrs. Margaret Winthrop,
begging her to send her a maid, “on that should be a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
good lusty seruant that hath skille in a dairy.”<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> But
how unsatisfactory the “lusty servant” proved a later
letter of Mrs. Dudley shows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I thought it convenient,” she writes, “to acquaint you and my
father what a great affliction I haue met withal by my maide servant,
and how I am like through God his mercie to be freed from it;
at her first coming me she carried her selfe dutifully as became a
servant; but since through mine and my husbands forbearance
towards her for small faults, she hath got such a head and is growen
soe insolent that her carriage towards vs, especially myselfe is vnsufferable.
If I bid her doe a thinge shee will bid me to doe it my selfe,
and she sayes how shee can give content as wel as any servant but
shee will not, and sayes if I loue not quietnes I was never so fitted in
my life, for shee would make mee haue enough of it. If I should
write to you of all the reviling speeches and filthie language shee
hath vsed towards me I should but grieue you. My husband hath vsed
all meanes for to reforme her, reasons and perswasions, but shee doth
professe that her heart and her nature will not suffer her to confesse
her faults. If I tell my husband of her behauiour towards me, vpon
examination shee will denie all that she hath done or spoken: so that
we know not how to proceede against her: but my husband now
hath hired another maide and is resolved to put her away the next
weeke.”<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Other members of the Winthrop family also have left
an account of their trials of this kind. A generation
later, July 7, 1682, Wait Winthrop wrote to Fitz-John
Winthrop, “I feare black Tom will do but little seruis.
He used to make a show of hanging himselfe before
folkes, but I believe he is not very nimble about it when
he is alone. Tis good to haue an eye to him, and if you
think it not worth while to keep him, eyther sell him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
or send him to Virginia or the West Indies before winter.
He can do something as a smith.”<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> In the third generation
John Winthrop, the son of Wait Winthrop, wrote
to his father from New London, Connecticut, 1717:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is not convenient now to write the trouble &amp; plague we have

<p>The trials of at least one Connecticut housekeeper are
hinted at in an Order of the General Court in 1645,
providing that a certain “Susan C., for her rebellious
carriage toward her mistress, is to be sent to the house
of correction and be kept to hard labor and coarse diet,
to be brought forth the next lecture day to be publicly
corrected, and so to be corrected weekly, until order be
given to the contrary.”<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>But it is undoubtedly in the legislation of the colonial
period that one finds the best reflection of colonial service,
and one may say of it, as Judge Sewall wrote to a friend
when sending him a copy of the Statutes at Large for
1684, “You will find much pleasant and profitable Reading
in it.”<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Numerous acts were passed in all the colonies
determining the relation between masters and servants,
and these laws were most explicit in protecting the
interests of both parties—a fact often indicated by the
very name of the act, as that of 1700 in Pennsylvania,
entitled “For the just encouragement of servants in the
discharge of their duty, and the prevention of their
deserting their master’s or owner’s service.”<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>In the legislation in regard to service and servants, it
is impossible always to discriminate between the general
class of either bound or life servants and the particular
class of domestic employees. But the smaller class was
comprised in the larger, and household servants had the
benefit of all legislation affecting servants as a whole.
Few or no laws were passed specifically for the benefit of
domestic employees.</p>

<p>These laws worked both ways. On the one hand, they
were intended to protect the servant from the selfishness
and cruelty of those masters who would be inclined to
take advantage of their position; on the other hand, they
protected the master who had invested his capital in
servants, and asked protection for it at the hands of the
law, as he sought protection for any other form of
property.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>Several general classes of laws are found for the protection
of servants. The first provides that no servant,
bound to serve his or her time in a province, could be
sold out of the province, without his or her consent.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> A
second class of laws compelled masters and mistresses to
provide their servants with wholesome and sufficient food,
clothing, and lodging;<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> and a third provided that if a
servant became ill during the time of his service, his master
should be under obligation to care for him, and heavy
penalties were sometimes incurred by a master who discharged
a servant when sick.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>The law went even further and protected servants
against unjust cruelty, especially against every form of
bodily maiming. If a white servant lost an eye or a tooth
at the hands of his master or mistress, he gained his freedom,
and could sometimes recover further compensation,
if the Court so adjudged.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> If servants fled from the
cruelty of their master, they were to be protected, though
notice of such protection was to be sent to the master and
the magistrate.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> In New York if a master or dame
tyrannically and cruelly abused a servant, the latter could
complain to the constable and overseers, who were instructed
to admonish the master on the first offence, and
on the second, to protect the servant in the house until
relief could be obtained through the Courts.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> In North
Carolina no Christian servant could be whipped without
an order from the justice of the peace; if any one presumed
so to do, the person offending was to pay forty
shillings to the party injured.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Immoderate punishment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
also subjected the master to appear before the County
Court to answer for his conduct.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> When New Jersey
became a royal province in 1702, the instructions of the
Crown to Lord Cornbury included a provision that he
should “endeavor to get a Law past for the restraining of
any inhuman Severity, which by ill Masters or Overseers,
may be used towards their Christian Servants, and their
Slaves, and that Provision be made therein, that the wilfull
killing of Indians and Negroes may be punished with
Death, and that a fit Penalty be imposed for the maiming
of them.”<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Moreover, in North Carolina complaints of
servants against their masters could be heard without
formal process of action.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> In Pennsylvania the law of
1771 provided that every indented servant should obtain
a legal residence in the city or place where he or she had
first served his or her master sixty days, or if he had
afterwards served twelve months in any other place, he
was at liberty to choose his residence in either place. In
South Carolina a master denying a certificate at the expiration
of a servant’s time was to forfeit two pounds.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>Important as these provisions were in the interest of
the servant, the law protected the master even more carefully
and specifically. The great danger to him was
in the loss of servants through their escaping from service
and being harbored by friendly sympathizers or rival
employers. The law dealt rigorously with both classes
of offenders. In South Carolina stubborn, refractory,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
and discontented servants, who ran away before their
term of service expired, were obliged to serve their
masters three times the period of their absence.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> In
Pennsylvania every servant absenting himself without
leave for one day or more was to serve, at the expiration
of his time, five days for every day’s absence, and in addition,
to give satisfaction to his master for any damages
or charges incurred through his absence.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> In East New
Jersey runaways were to serve double the time of their
absence, and also to give satisfaction for the costs and
damages caused by their absence.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> In North Carolina
runaways who would not tell the name of their master,
either because unable to speak English or through obstinacy,
were to be committed to jail and advertised for two
months. Servants absenting themselves were to serve
double time.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> In South Carolina a servant who ran away
was to serve one week for every day’s absence, but the
whole time was not to exceed two years.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Servants running
away with slaves were to be considered felons. In
Maryland absenting servants were to serve additional
time at the discretion of the Court, ten days, or not exceeding
that, for every day’s absence, and to give satisfaction
for costs incurred.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>The temptation to harbor runaways was great, not so
much from philanthropic motives as because of the scarcity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
of labor, and every colony supplemented its legislation
against runaways by corresponding acts carrying penalties
for harboring them. In East New Jersey the offender
was fined five pounds and was to make full satisfaction
to the master or mistress for costs and damages sustained
because of the absence, while any person who knowingly
harbored or entertained a runaway, “except of real charity,”
was to pay the master or mistress of the servant ten
shillings for every day’s entertainment and concealment
and to be fined at the discretion of the Court.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> In Connecticut
the presumption was that if servants were entertained
after nine o’clock at night they were runaways,
and the head of the family so entertaining them was to
forfeit five shillings to the complainer and five shillings
to the town treasurer. Any Indian hiding a runaway
was to forfeit forty shillings for every such offence or
suffer a month’s imprisonment.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> In South Carolina runaways
were not to be harbored under a penalty of two
pounds for every day and night the servant was so entertained,
but the total amount forfeited was not to exceed
treble the value of the servant’s time remaining to be
served.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> In New York any one proved to have connived
at the absence of a servant was to forfeit twenty pounds
to the master or dame and five pounds to the Court.
Any one knowingly harboring a runaway was to forfeit
ten shillings for every day’s entertainment.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> In Pennsylvania
any one concealing a servant forfeited twenty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
shillings for each day’s concealment.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> In Rhode Island
any person entertaining a servant after nine o’clock at
night forfeited five shillings for each offence.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> In Maryland,
by an act of 1692, persons harboring runaways were
to forfeit five hundred pounds of tobacco for every hour’s
entertainment, one half to the government and one half
to the informer.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> By a later act the person harboring
runaways was to forfeit one hundred pounds of tobacco
for every hour’s entertainment, one half to go to the
public schools and one half to the party aggrieved.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> This
was intended to meet evasions of the previous laws on
the part of those who harbored runaways a few hours at
a time and then helped them on their way. Free negroes
or mulattoes harboring runaways were to forfeit one thousand
pounds of tobacco for every such offence, one half
for the use of free schools and one half to the party
aggrieved.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> By a later act, servants harboring runaways
were to be punished by the magistrate by lashes, not to
exceed thirty-nine, on the bare back.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, every incentive was held out to
assist in the return of runaways. In North Carolina any
person who assisted in taking up runaways was rewarded,
the reward being gauged by the number of miles away
from the master’s house that the servant was taken.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> In
Pennsylvania any one apprehending a runaway servant
and returning him or her to the sheriff of the county was
to receive ten shillings if the runaway was taken within<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
ten miles of the master’s house and twenty shillings if at
a distance of more than ten miles.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> In Connecticut any
Indian who returned a runaway to the nearest authority
was to receive as a reward two yards of cloth.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> In
Maryland the allowance was two hundred pounds of
tobacco, while Indians were to receive a match coat or its
value.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Persons in Virginia, Delaware, or the northern
parts of America, who apprehended runaways from Maryland,
were to receive four hundred pounds of tobacco, and
the servant was to reimburse his master by additional
servitude.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Every precaution to prevent runaways was
taken. Indian, negro, and mulatto servants were not to
travel without a pass,<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> nor were slaves to leave their plantation
without leave, except negroes wearing liveries.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
In Connecticut servants were not to go abroad after nine
o’clock at night,<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> in Massachusetts they were not to frequent
public houses,<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> and in South Carolina and Massachusetts
innkeepers were not to harbor them.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>Yet the life under a master or mistress was often such
as to tempt a servant to escape; added to a condition
that often involved hard work, poor lodging, and insufficient
food and clothing, was the infliction of humiliating
corporal punishment in case of disobedience or disorder.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
In Connecticut a servant could be punished by the magistrate
not to exceed ten stripes for one offence.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> The
Rhode Island law was similar.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> In North Carolina runaways
were to receive from the constable as many lashes
as the justice of the peace should think fit, “not exceeding
the Number of thirty-nine, well laid on, on the Back
of such Runaway,” while disobedient servants were to be
punished with corporal punishment, not to exceed twenty-one
lashes. In cases where free persons suffered punishment
by being fined, servants were whipped.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> In South
Carolina a servant for striking his master or mistress was
to serve not more than six months’ additional time, or be
punished with not more than twenty-one stripes.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> In
Massachusetts and New York any servants who had been
unfaithful, negligent, or unprofitable in their service, notwithstanding
good usage from their masters, were not to
be dismissed until they had made satisfaction according
to the judgment of the civil authorities.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>In nearly every colony heavy penalties followed attempts
to carry on trade or barter with servants. In
North Carolina a freeman trading with a servant forfeited
treble the value of the goods traded for and six pounds in
addition; if unable to pay the fine he was himself sold as
a servant. A servant trading or selling the property of
his master was to serve his master additional time, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
length to be fixed by the Court.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> In East New Jersey
the penalty was five pounds for the first offence and ten
pounds for each subsequent one; the offending servant
was to be whipped by the person to whom he had tendered
such sale, the reward of half a crown being paid by
the master or mistress to the person administering the
punishment.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> In Pennsylvania any one trading secretly
with a servant was to forfeit to the master three times the
value of the goods, and the servant at the expiration of his
time was to render satisfaction to the master to double
the value of the goods, and, if black, was to be whipped
in the most public place in the township.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Trading with
servants was prohibited in Connecticut<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> and in Massachusetts.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
In South Carolina any one buying, selling, or
bartering with a servant was to forfeit treble the value of
the goods and ten pounds to the informer; the offending
servant was to be whipped on the bare back in the watch-house
at Charleston.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> In New York servants were forbidden
to trade under penalty of fine or corporal punishment.
Those trading with servants were to restore the
commodities to the master and to forfeit double their
value to the poor of the parish.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> In Maryland the penalty
was two thousand pounds of tobacco, one half to go
to the king and one half to the master.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>Many miscellaneous provisions in different colonies
must have seemed oppressive. In New Jersey and South
Carolina servants could not marry without the consent of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
their masters.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> In Massachusetts no covenant servant in
the household with any other could be an office holder.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
In Pennsylvania innkeepers were forbidden to trust
them.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> In North Carolina servants making false complaints
in regard to illness were to serve double the time
lost, and the same penalty followed if they were sent to
jail for any offence.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> No slave was to go armed in North
Carolina, and if one was found offending, the person making
the discovery was to appropriate the weapon for his
own use, and the servant was to receive twenty lashes on
his or her bare back. One servant on each plantation,
however, was exempted from the law, but such an one
must carry a certificate of permission.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> In Massachusetts
servants were to be catechised once a week<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> and
were not to wear apparel exceeding the quality and condition
of their persons or estates under penalty of admonition
for the first offence, a fine of twenty shillings for
the second, and forty shillings for the third offence.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>The obligation of the master to a servant-owning and
slave-owning community was recognized in North Carolina
in a positive law prohibiting a master from setting
free a negro or mulatto on any pretence whatsoever,
except for meritorious services to be judged and allowed
by the County Court, and even in this case a license was
to be previously obtained.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> In Massachusetts Bay servants
were not to be set free until they had served out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
their time.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> In Connecticut a slave set free was to be
maintained by his master if he came to want.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>In view of all these restrictions on servants of a personal,
industrial, and political character it seems strange
that even any from their number should have been able,
at the expiration of their term of service, to break away
from the spirit of this bondage and reach a higher position
in the social scale; yet many of the redemptioners
became in time, especially at the North, respectable
and even prominent members of the community.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> The
women often married planters<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> and in turn became the
employers of servants. Yet these are the exceptions.
For a long time the redemptioners were considered the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
off-scourings of English cities, and they formed a distinct
class in the social order lower than their masters or
employers. In view of this fact, a reproach was of
necessity attached to all belonging to the class and to
the designation applied to them. Their descendants
ultimately formed the class of poor whites,—the lowest
stratum in the social order whose members were held in
contempt even by the negroes.</p>

<p>It has been said that the redemptioners were found in
all the colonies, though they were more numerous in the
Middle and Southern colonies than in New England. But
it was difficult to keep white servants for any length of
time in a country where land was cheap and the servant
soon in turn became a master.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> It was undoubtedly this
difficulty that led to the substitution for white servants of
Indians and negro slaves. Indian servants were apparently
more numerous in the New England colonies, while
negro slavery gained its strongest foothold in the South.</p>

<p>The employment of Indians as servants grew up naturally
in New England and was continued for at least
a hundred years.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Their presence was regarded as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
almost providential by the New Englanders, hard pressed
for assistance in house and field. When the question of
the right and wrong of the matter was suggested by the
troubled conscience, an easy answer was found: was it
not sin to suffer them longer to maintain the worship of
the devil when they were needed so sorely as slaves?<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
But like the redemptioners, their service so eagerly
sought often proved unsatisfactory. Hugh Peter wrote
to John Winthrop, September 4, 1639, “My wife desires
my daughter to send to Hanna that was her mayd, now at
Charltowne, to know if shee would dwell with vs, for
truly wee are so destitute (hauing now but an Indian)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
that wee know not what to doe.”<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> More unfortunate
still was the young clergyman, the Rev. Peter Thatcher.
He records in his diary at Barnstable, May 7, 1679, “I
bought an Indian of Mr. Checkley and was to pay 5£ a
month after I received her and five pound more in a quarter
of a year.” A week later he writes, “Came home
and found my Indian girl had liked to have knocked my
Theodora on head by letting her fall, whereupon I took
a good walnut stick and beat the Indian to purpose till
she promised to do so no more.”<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>In every section negro slavery grew up side by side
with white and Indian slavery,<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> though its hold even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
upon the South was far from strong until the end of
the seventeenth century. It is both unnecessary and
impossible to discuss in this place the question of slavery<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
and its relation to the larger subject of service. The
close of the colonial period saw it firmly established at
the South, where it supplanted the system of white servitude,
while at the North both black and white slavery
gave place to free labor.</p>

<p>The details of the history of domestic service during
the colonial period may seem unnecessary to an understanding
of domestic service as it is to-day, but an examination
of them must show the existence during that
period of principles and conditions that must modify
the judgment concerning the conditions of to-day. No
wish is more often expressed than that it might be possible
to return to the Arcadian days when service was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
abundant, excellent, and cheap. But those days did not
exist in America during the colonial period. The conditions
at that time bear a marked resemblance to those
of to-day. The social position of all servants was lower
than that of their employers, and the gulf between the
two was more difficult to span. Service was difficult to
obtain and unsatisfactory when secured. Servants complained
of hard work and ill treatment, and masters of
ungrateful servants and inefficient service, and both
masters and servants were justified in their complaints.
The legal relations between master and servant were
explicitly defined as regards length of service, wages
paid, and the mutual obligations of both parties to the
contract during the period of service. But this very
definiteness of the contract was due to the fact that the
relationship between the two parties was an arbitrary one
and could not have been preserved without this legal
assistance. In default of a better one, the system of
white servitude may have served its age fairly well; but
its restoration, if the restoration were possible, would
do nothing to relieve in any way the strain and pressure
of present conditions.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br>
<span class="smaller">DOMESTIC SERVICE SINCE THE COLONIAL PERIOD</span></h2>

</div>

<p>It has been said that domestic service in America has
passed through three distinct phases. The second phase
began about the time of the Revolution, when at the North
the indented servants as a class were gradually supplanted
by free laborers, and at the South by negro slaves who
inherited with large interest the reproach attached to the
redemptioners. The social chasm that had existed at
the North between employer and employee, under the system
of bonded servants, disappeared. The free laborers,
whether employed in domestic service or otherwise, were
socially the equal of their employers, especially in New
England and in the smaller towns. They belonged by
birth to the same section of the country, probably to the
same community; they had the same religious belief,
attended the same church, sat at the same fireside, ate at
the same table, had the same associates; they were often
married from the homes<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> and buried in the family lots of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
their employers.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> They were in every sense of the word
“help.”<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> A survival of this condition is seen to-day in
farming communities, especially at the West. In the
South, on the contrary, the social chasm became impassable
as negro slavery entirely displaced white labor.</p>

<p>This democratic condition at the North seemed especially
noteworthy to European travellers,<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> and it was one
to which they apparently never became accustomed.
Harriet Martineau, in planning for her American journey,
was perplexed by the difficulty of securing a travelling
companion. “It would never do,” she says, “as I was
aware, to take a servant, to suffer from the proud Yankees
on the one hand and the debased slaves on the
other.”<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> On arriving here, she found “the study of
domestic service a continual amusement,” and what she
saw “would fill a volume.”<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> “Boarding-house life,” she
says, “has been rendered compulsory by the scarcity of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
labour,—the difficulty of obtaining domestic service.”<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
But she was quick to appreciate the difference between
the spirit of service she found in America and that with
which she was familiar in the old world. She writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I had rather suffer any inconvenience from having to work occasionally
in chambers and kitchen, and from having little hospitable
designs frustrated, than witness the subservience in which the menial
class is held in Europe. In England, servants have been so long
accustomed to this subservience; it is so completely the established
custom for the mistress to regulate their manners, their clothes, their
intercourse with friends, and many other things which they ought to
manage for themselves, that it has become difficult to treat them any
better. Mistresses who abstain from such regulation find that they
are spoiling their servants; and heads of families who would make
friends of their domestics find them little fitted to reciprocate the duty.
In America it is otherwise: and may it ever be so!... One of the
pleasures of travelling through a democratic country is the seeing no
liveries. No such badge of menial service is to be met with throughout
the States, except in the houses of the foreign ambassadors at
Washington.”</p>

</div>

<p>She then gives illustrations to show “of how much
higher a character American domestic service is than any
which would endure to be distinguished by a badge.”<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p>De Tocqueville, also, found, that “the condition of
domestic service does not degrade the character of those
who enter upon it, because it is freely chosen, and adopted
for a time only; because it is not stigmatized by public
opinion and creates no permanent inequality between the
servant and the master.”<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>Francis J. Grund was also able to appreciate the difference
between external servility and true self-respect, for
he writes in 1837: “There are but few native Americans
who would submit to the degradation of wearing a livery,
or any other badge of servitude. This they would call
becoming a man’s man. But, on the other hand, there
are also but few American gentlemen who would feel any
happier for their servants wearing coats of more than one
color. The inhabitants of New England are quite as
willing to call their servants ‘helps,’ or ‘domestics,’ as
the latter repudiate the title of ‘master’ in their employers.”
And he adds, “Neither is an American servant
that same indolent, careless, besotted being as an European.”
He has another word of praise too for the American
servants, “who work harder, and <i>quicker</i> than even
in England.”<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>The absence of livery was a subject of constant comment.
William Cobbett, in 1828, asserts that “the man
(servant) will not wear a <i>livery</i>, any more than he will
wear a halter round his neck.... Neither men nor women
will allow you to call them <i>servants</i>, and they will take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
especial care not to call themselves by that name.” He
explains the avoidance of the term “servant” by the fact
that slaves were called servants by the English, who having
fled from tyranny at home were shy of calling others
slaves; free men therefore would not be called servants.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>But while the democratic spirit that prevailed during
this period found commendation in the eyes of those of
similar tendencies, it often evoked only mild surprise or
a half sneer. Mrs. Trollope found that “the greatest
difficulty in organizing a family established in Ohio, is
getting servants, or, as it is there called, ‘getting help,’
for it is more than petty treason to the Republic to call a
free citizen a <i>servant</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> Chevalier asserted that “on
Sunday an American would not venture to receive his
friends; his servants would not consent to it, and he can
hardly secure their services for himself, at their own hour,
on that day.”<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Samuel Breck considers that “in these
United States nothing would be wanting to make life
perfectly happy (humanly speaking) had we good servants.”<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
Isabella Bird wrote of Canada in 1854, “The
great annoyance of which people complain in this pleasant
land is the difficulty of obtaining domestic servants,
and the extraordinary specimens of humanity who go out
in this capacity.” “The difficulty of procuring servants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
is one of the great objections to this colony. The few
there are know nothing of any individual department of
work,—for instance, there are neither cooks nor housemaids,
they are strictly ‘<i>helps</i>,’—the mistress being expected
to take more than her fair share of the work.”<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
The conditions she found there were the same as in the
United States.</p>

<p>Thomas Grattan wrote of the condition:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“One of the subjects on which the minds of men and women in the
United States seem to be unanimously made up, is the admitted deficiency
of <i>help</i>.... Disguise it as we may, under all the specious
forms of reasoning, there is something in the mind of every man
which tells him he is humiliated in doing personal service to another....
The servile nature of domestic duties in Europe, and more
particularly in England, is much more likely to make servants liable
to the discontent which mars their merits, than the common understanding
in America, which makes the compact between ‘employer’
and ‘help’ a mere matter of business, entailing no mean submission
on the one hand, and giving no right to any undue assumption of
power on the other.... Domestic service is not considered so disgraceful
in the United States, as it is felt to be in the United
Kingdom.”<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Grattan’s observations lead him to believe that the
democratic spirit is not always to be deplored.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“An American youth or ‘young lady’ will go to service willingly,
if they can be better paid for it than for teaching in a village school,
or working on a farm or in a factory.... They satisfy themselves
that they are <i>helps</i>, not servants,—that they are going to work with
(not for) Mr. so and so, not going to service,—they call him and his
wife their <i>employers</i>, not their master and mistress.”<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p>But like all Europeans, he never ceases to be surprised
by this spirit, particularly by those manifestations of it
that led to active work on the part of the mistress of a
home and to the use of the word “help.” “There are no
housekeepers,” he writes, “or ladies’ maids. The lady
herself does all the duties of the former.... Servants
are thus really justified in giving to themselves the favorite
designation of ‘helps.’”<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> But he closes a long and
interesting chapter on the subject with the prophecy,
“They (employers) will, by degrees, give up the employment
of native servants who will be in future less likely
than even now to submit to their pretensions, and confine
themselves to the fast increasing tribes of Irish immigrants.”<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>Curiously enough nearly forty years earlier Madame
d’Arusmont had written of friends who thought of coming
to America and urged, “Let them by all means be
advised against bringing servants with them. Foreign
servants are here, without doubt, the worst; they neither
understand the work which the climate renders necessary,
nor are willing to do the work which they did elsewhere.”<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
She, like all travellers, found that however
subservient domestic servants might be when they left
Europe, the first contact with the democratic atmosphere
of America wrought a sudden change; subserviency disappeared,
and the servant boasted of his equality with all.
She explains that those educated in America perceive the
difference placed between the gentleman and the laborer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
by education and conditions, but the foreigner taking a
superficial view of the matter sees no difference.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>This second period in the history of domestic service
continued from about the time of the Revolution until
1850. It was the product of the rapid growth of democratic
ideas fostered by the Revolution and the widespread
influence of the French philosophical ideas of the
latter part of the eighteenth century. It was a period
chiefly characterized by social and industrial democracy,
as the political system was also in its spirit democratic.
This democratic industrial spirit showed itself in the universal
use at the North of the term “help,” in the absence
of liveries and all distinguishing marks of service, in the
intolerance on the part of both employer and employee
of servility and subserviency of manner, in the bridging of
the social chasm between master and servant as long as
the free employment of native born Americans continued,
and in the hearty spirit of willingness with which service
was performed. The results of this democratic régime
were the difficulty of securing help, since new avenues
of independent work were opening out to women and the
class of indented servants had disappeared; the lack of
all differentiation in household work, since the servant
conferred a favor in “going out to work” and did what
she knew how to do without troubling to learn new kinds
of work; and, most important, the subtle change that
the democratic atmosphere everywhere wrought in the
servants who came from Europe.</p>

<p>This condition of free, democratic, native born white
service at the North and compulsory slave service at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
South continued practically unchanged until about the
middle of the century. Between 1850 and 1870 four important
political changes occurred which revolutionized
the personnel in domestic service and consequently its
character. These changes brought about the third period
in the history of the subject.</p>

<p>The first of these changes was due to the Irish famine
of 1846. Previous to this time the immigration to this
country from Ireland had been small, averaging not more
than twenty thousand annually between 1820 and 1846.
In the decade preceding the famine the average number
of arrivals had been less than thirty-five thousand annually.
In 1846 the number was 51,752, and this was more than
doubled the following year, the report showing 105,536
arrivals in 1847. In 1851 the number of arrivals from
Ireland had risen to 221,253. Since that time the number
has fluctuated, but between fifty and seventy-five thousand
annually come to this country from Ireland.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> A large
proportion of these immigrants—forty-nine per cent during
the decade from 1870 to 1880—have been women who
were classed as “unskilled laborers.” Two occupations
were open to them. One was work in factories where as
manufacturing processes became more simple unskilled
labor could be utilized. The Irish immigrants, therefore,
soon displaced in factories the New England women who
had found, as has been seen,<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> new opportunities for work
of a higher grade. The second occupation open to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
Irish immigrants was household service. Here physical
strength formed a partial compensation for lack of skill
and ignorance of American ways, and the Irish soon came
to form a most numerous and important class engaged in
domestic employments.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>A second important European change, influencing the
condition of domestic service, was the German Revolution
of 1848 with the events preceding and resulting from it.
Before this period the emigration from Germany had
been insignificant, fewer than fifteen thousand having
come to this country annually between 1830 and 1840.
In 1840, owing to political reasons, the number had risen
to 29,704. It soon became evident that the hopes raised
by the accession of the new monarch were without foundation,
and emigration rapidly increased until the number
of emigrants coming to America reached 74,281 in 1847.
During the year of the Revolution the number decreased,
but the failure of the cause of the revolutionary party
and the political apathy that followed again increased the
movement towards America. This reached its climax in
1854, when the sympathies of the Court had been openly
expressed during the Crimean War in favor of Russian
despotism. During this year the number of Germans
arriving in this country was 215,009—a number equalled
but once since that time, although the number has averaged
nearly a hundred and fifty thousand annually during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
the last decade.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> A large number of these immigrants
have been women, the proportion of women emigrating
from Germany being greater than from any other foreign
country except Ireland.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> The ranks of domestic service
have been recruited from their number also, the Germans
being second only to the Irish as regards the number and
proportion engaged in this occupation.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>A third political influence affecting the question was
the establishment of treaty relations between the United States
and China in 1844. This fact and the discovery
of gold in California in 1848, together with the building of
the Union Pacific railroad in 1867-1869, opened the doors
to the immigration of considerable numbers of Chinese.
Many of these found their way into domestic service, and
on the Pacific coast they became formidable competitors
of household servants of other nationalities.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>The political and economic conditions in Europe and
the breaking down of long-established customs in Asia
have thus since 1850 brought to this country large numbers
of men and women who have performed the household
service previously done by native born Americans.
The presence of the Irish in the East, of the Germans in
the West, of the Scandinavians in the Northwest, and of
the Chinese on the Pacific coast has thus introduced a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
new social, as well as a new economic, element at the
North. It has led to a change in the relation of employer
and employee; the class line which was only
faintly drawn in the early part of the century between
employer and “help” has been changed into a caste line
which many employers believe it to their interest to preserve.
The native born American fears to lose social
position by entering into competition with foreign labor.</p>

<p>While this change, owing to political conditions in the
Old World, was taking place at the North in the character
of the service, a similar change was taking place at the
South growing out of the abolition of slavery in 1863.
The negroes who had previously performed all domestic
service for their personal expenses have since then received
for the same service a small remuneration in
money. This fact prevents now as effectually as during
the slavery period any competition in domestic service
on the part of native born white employees. It does not
prevent all competition on the part of foreign born white
employees, since prejudice against the negro does not
exist in Europe owing to the fact that negro slavery has
not prevailed there. The effects of these great movements
upon the nature and personnel of domestic service
will be discussed later in considering its present condition.
They have had a direct and conspicuous influence
on the condition of domestic service and even in the use
of the term applied to those who engage in it.</p>

<p>But other political influences more subtle and possibly
more far-reaching in their effect have been at work.
Our loose naturalization laws, and the determining of
the qualifications for the right of suffrage by as many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
standards as there are states, have made the enormous
number of men coming to this country annually an easy
prey to scheming politicians and demagogues. The labor
vote, the Irish vote, the German vote, have been flattered
and sought by party managers until the wage-earning
man feels that “like Atlas of old he carries the world
on his shoulders.” If the laboring man feels the weight
of the world, his wife and daughter believe that some
share of the burden rests on them. The democratic
tendencies of the country, the political practices of the
day, have everywhere broken down the high wall of
separation between employer and employee. They are
subversive even in the household of that patriarchal relationship
that has been driven from every stronghold but
this.</p>

<p>While the political movements of the century have thus
changed the personnel of domestic service in America, the
development of the material resources of the country has
affected its status. Before the present century employees
of every kind were in a sense stationary. This was due
partly to the influence of the English poor laws; partly
to the system of indenture which bound a servant for
seven, five, or four years, and to the system of slavery
which bound the servant for life; partly to the system of
apprenticeship which made the servant a member of the
family of his master; partly to the custom prevailing in
the country districts and small towns for unmarried workmen
in all industries to board with their employers; and
partly to the lack of facilities for cheap and easy means of
communication between different sections of the country.
There was no mobility of labor as regards either employment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
or place of employment—a fact true alike of domestic
service and of other occupations. But this condition
of affairs gradually changed. As has been seen, indented
servants disappeared and every employee was free to break
as well as to make an engagement for service. The establishment
of the factory system of manufactures and
the consequent substitution of mechanical for skilled
processes of labor broke down the system of apprenticeship,
and workmen of every occupation, except domestic
service, ceased to be members of the families of their
employers. A mobility of labor was made possible such
as could not have been secured under the old system. At
a later time the great era of railroad development and
similar enterprises gave opportunity for a certain mobility
as regards place of employment. The tide of western
emigration due to the discovery of gold and the cheapness
of western land caused much shifting of labor among
the non-capitalist class, and this was increased as means of
communication were rendered more easy. The establishment
of companies to encourage foreign immigration with
the object of developing the material resources of the
country was another weight in the scale in favor of
greater mobility of labor as regards both place and employment.
The abolition of slavery removed the last
important legal barrier against perfect mobility.</p>

<p>All of these industrial movements have been important
factors in changing the condition and character of domestic
service. It is true, in a general sense, that every great
change in economic conditions affects all occupations.
But domestic service has through these causes been
affected in certain specific ways. The employee who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
disliked housework, but to whom no other occupation
had been open, could go into a factory or a mill, since
no time was consumed in learning the simple processes
of mechanical work. Every invention formed the basis
for a new occupation. Domestic service had a hundred
competitors in a field where before the era of inventions
it had stood alone. Moreover, these new occupations
required little skill, no preparation, and possessed the
charm of novelty. Again, the rapid development of
railroad interests, with the increase of competition and
consequent lowering of passenger rates, often influenced
families emigrating to the West to take with them their
trusted employees. The same fact made it possible for
women seeking new employments to go from place to place
in ways unthought of in the early part of the century.</p>

<p>In view of these changed and changing economic conditions
it may be said that the immobility of labor, which
has seemed to some economists so great an obstacle to
the industrial advancement of women,<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> has practically
ceased to exist in the case of domestic service. In fact,
industrial development has so far changed conditions that
the problem has now come to be how to make this form
of labor not more mobile, but more stable. One illustration
of this is found in the fact that when seven hundred
domestic employees represented on the schedules were
asked how many of them had ever been engaged in any
other occupation, twenty-seven per cent replied that they
had. The mobility as to the place of labor was found
to be even greater. Twenty-seven per cent of the native
born employees did not reside in the same state in which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
they were born, and adding to these the number of
foreign born, it was found that sixty-eight per cent did
not reside in their native country or state. Moreover,
this statement is below the truth as it does not take into
account the number of changes made within a single
year and refers to only one change from place of birth
to present residence.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>An indication of these various changes in the condition
of domestic service during these different periods
is seen in the history of the word “servant.” As used
in England and in law at the time of the settlement of
the American colonies it signified any employee, and no
odium was in any way attached to the word.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> But five<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
things led to its temporary disuse: first, the reproach
connected with the word through the character and
social rank of the redemptioners; second, the fact that
when the redemptioners gave place at the South to
negro slaves the word “servant” was transferred to this
class,<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> and this alone was sufficient to prevent its application
to whites;<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> third, the levelling tendencies that
always prevail in a new country; fourth, the literal interpretation
of the preamble of the Declaration of Independence;
and fifth, the new social and political theories
resulting from the introduction of French philosophical
ideas. At the North the word “help” as applied especially
to women superseded the word “servant,” while
at the South the term “servant” was applied only to
the negro. From the time of the Revolution, therefore,
until about 1850 the word “servant” does not seem to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
have been generally applied in either section to white
persons of American birth.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>Since the introduction of foreign labor at the middle
of the century, the word “servant” has again come into
general use as applied to white employees, not, however,
as a survival of the old colonial word, but as a reintroduction
from Europe of a term signifying one who performs
so-called menial labor, and it is restricted in its
use, except in a legal sense, to persons who perform
domestic service. The present use of the word has come
not only from the almost exclusive employment of foreigners
in domestic service, but also because of the
increase of wealth and consequent luxury in this country,
the growing class divisions, and the adoption of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
many European habits of living and thinking and
speaking.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>These simple historical facts are one explanation of the
unwillingness of American women to engage in work stigmatized
by an offensive term applied to no other class of
laborers.</p>

<p>In studying the question of domestic service, therefore,
the fact cannot be overlooked that certain historical
influences have affected its conditions; that political
revolutions have changed its personnel, and industrial
development its mobility. It is as impossible to dream
of restoring the former condition of household service as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
it is of restoring former household employments, and
neither is to be desired. In each case the question is one
of preparing for the next step in the process of evolution,
not of retrograding toward a condition impossible to
restore. Any attempt to secure a change for the better
in the present condition of domestic service must be ineffective
if it does not take into consideration these historic
aspects of the subject.</p>

</div>

<p>The attempt has been made in the foregoing chapters
to indicate the extent to which domestic employments
and domestic service have been influenced by industrial
and political events arising outside of the household, and
apparently having little or no connection with it. That
domestic service is amenable to some of the general economic
laws and conditions which affect other occupations
and that it is also governed by economic laws developed
within itself will perhaps be evident from an examination
of a few of these economic conditions and principles.
These may be stated for the sake of brevity in the form
of propositions.</p>

<p>The first group of propositions to be suggested concerns
the number and distribution of persons of foreign
birth engaged in domestic service.</p>

<p>(1) A large proportion of the domestic employees in
the United States are of foreign birth. This is evident
from the following table prepared from the schedules sent
out:<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>The statement may be more fully illustrated from the
Eleventh Census, which shows that the number of foreign
born in domestic service is 30.86 per cent of the entire
number.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> The geographical distribution of the different
classes of domestic employees is seen from Table II on
the following page.</p>

<p>Another illustration of the same point is found by an
examination of the relative number of native born and foreign
born domestic employees in the individual states and
territories. In nine states and territories the number
of foreign born domestic employees exceeds the number
of native born white employees,<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> in sixteen about one
half of the white domestic employees are of foreign birth,<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>
in twenty-four states and territories the number of native
born white employees largely exceeds the foreign born,<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
while in fifteen states colored employees are in excess.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
It will be seen that the states in which the number of
native born white domestic employees exceeds the number
of the foreign born are those states having relatively
a small number of foreign born residents.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> A still more
specific illustration is found in the experience of one
state. In Massachusetts in 1885, the foreign born
domestic servants formed 60.24 per cent of the entire
number.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>These different illustrations seem to show the truth
of the proposition stated.</p>

<p>(2) The converse of the preceding proposition is also
true—the concentration of women of foreign birth
engaged in remunerative occupations is on domestic
service.</p>

<p>The Eleventh Census shows that, in 1890, 59.37 per cent
of all foreign white women at work were engaged in
domestic and personal service. This leaves only 40.63
per cent to be distributed among all other gainful
occupations.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> A specific illustration in the case of an
individual state is seen in Massachusetts. Here the percentage
of the foreign born in the entire population is
27.13, while, as stated above, the number of foreign born
women in domestic service is 60.24 per cent.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>(3) The foreign born population as a class seek the
large cities.</p>

<p>In 1890 the persons of foreign birth in the United<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
States formed 14.77 per cent of the entire population.
But of the total foreign population, 44.13 per cent was
found in the one hundred and twenty-four cities having
a population of twenty-five thousand or more.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>(4) The foreign countries having the largest absolute
representation in the largest cities are Ireland, Germany,
Great Britain, Sweden, and Canada and Newfoundland.
The following table shows the relative number of persons
born in these countries who are found in the United
States as a whole, and in the large cities:</p>

<p>This group of five propositions in regard to the number
and distribution of the foreign born engaged in
domestic service seems to indicate that in this country,
with the exception of the sections employing colored servants,
domestic service is as a rule performed by persons
of foreign birth belonging to a few well-defined classes as
regards nationality, who prefer city to country life. The
facts given are an understatement of the influence exerted
on domestic service by persons of foreign extraction, since
they do not take into consideration the factor of foreign
parentage.</p>

<p>A second group of propositions may be suggested in
regard to the general distribution of domestic employees.</p>

<p>(1) The number of domestic servants is absolutely and
relatively small in agricultural and sparsely settled states.</p>

<p>This will be evident by the reference to the accompanying
chart, which shows the number of persons to each
domestic servant in each of the states. The states last
in the list, where the smallest relative number of servants
is employed, are all large in area, and as a rule have the
smallest population in proportion to the area of settlement.
This condition is probably due to the two facts
that all housework is as a rule performed without remuneration
by housewives, since they are more free from
social and other interruptions than are women in cities,
and also to the aversion of domestics as a class to country
life.</p>

<p>(2) The number of domestic servants is absolutely and
relatively large in those states containing a large urban
population.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp61" id="chart1" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Chart showing the Number of Persons to each Domestic Employee in
the Various States and Territories and the District of Columbia</span></p></figcaption>
  <img class="w100" src="images/chart1.jpg" alt=" ">
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p>This is also made evident by the diagram. Forty-nine
of the fifty largest cities in the United States are found
in the first thirty-four states in the list; only one of the
fifty is found in the last fifteen states. The fact is apparently
most clearly shown in the case of the District of
Columbia, which has an almost exclusively urban population
and ranks first with reference to the number of servants
employed. The condition here, however, is due not
so much to its urban character as to the employment of
colored help and the fact that the city contains an abnormally
large number of temporary residents requiring a
disproportionate amount of service. The truth of the
proposition is better indicated by the examples of New
York, Massachusetts, and New Jersey, which stand nearly
at the head of the list and contain seventeen of the fifty
largest cities.</p>

<p>(3) The aggregate wealth of a state has little appreciable
effect on the relative number of domestic servants
employed.</p>

<p>This is evident from a study of the relative true and
assessed valuation of real and personal property in the
different states.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> In more than one half the states it has
no apparent connection whatever with the relative number
of servants.</p>

<p>(4) The per capita wealth of a state has, with the exception
of the Southern states as a class, a somewhat important
bearing on the relative number of servants employed.</p>

<p>This will be seen from an examination of the per capita
assessed valuations of real and personal property in the
various states.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> The rank of each state in the class of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
per capita wealth and in the relative number of domestic
servants employed, with the exception named, does not
vary materially. The variation in the Southern states is
due to the presence of negro employees. The extremely
low wages paid by employers enables them to command
the services of a larger number of persons for the same
expenditure of money than is possible at the North.</p>

<p>These facts may be considered as indicative in a general
way of the truth of the current opinion that an increase
in income generally shows itself first in the employment
of additional service. They prove nothing absolutely on
this point, however, as they are too general in character.</p>

<p>(5) Domestic employees are found in the largest numbers,
relatively and absolutely, in the large cities. The
fifty largest cities in the United States contain 18.04 per
cent of the total population of the country. They have,
however, 32.32 per cent of the total number of domestic
servants. To put the same fact in another way, domestic
servants constitute 2.32 per cent of the total population,
but 4.07 per cent of the population of the fifty largest
cities. The force of gravity exerted, therefore, by the
large cities seems to act with nearly twice the power on
the class of domestic employees that it does on the population
as a whole.</p>

<p>The conclusion seems to follow that in general employers
in large cities have less difficulty in securing
servants than have persons living elsewhere, but that
they are practically restricted in their choice to those of
foreign birth. The conclusion does not follow that these
employers have less difficulty than have others in dealing
with the question of domestic service, since the facts given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
concern only the number of servants, not the quality of
service.</p>

<p>(6) The proportion of persons engaged in domestic
service varies with geographical location and prevailing
industry.</p>

<p>This fact is indicated by the chart, which shows that in
Southern cities, where the colored population is large,
and in New York and Boston, which are ports of entry
and therefore able to secure a large number of foreign
born servants, the proportion of servants to the total
population is large. In cities where the leading occupation
is manufacturing, as Lowell, Paterson, and Fall River,
the proportion of servants is small. In cities where
the industrial conditions are similar the proportions are
similar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp61" id="chart2" style="max-width: 31.25em;">

  <img class="w100" src="images/chart2.jpg" alt=" ">
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>The same fact may be illustrated in two other ways. In
Washington, Richmond, Atlanta, Memphis, and Nashville,—the
five cities having the largest number of domestic
employees in proportion to the population,—the domestic
employees constitute in each city more than fourteen per
cent of the entire number of persons engaged in all gainful
occupations. In these five cities more than one third
of all women engaged in remunerative occupations are in
domestic service. On the other hand, in Camden, Trenton,
Lowell, Paterson, and Fall River,—the five cities
having the smallest number of domestic employees in
proportion to the population,—the per cent of domestic
employees with reference to the total number of persons
engaged in all gainful occupations is less than seven,
while in Lowell and Paterson only ten per cent and in
Fall River only seven per cent of all women engaged in
remunerative occupations are in domestic service. The
following table will show these contrasts:</p>

<p>(7) Neither per capita wealth nor aggregate wealth
has an appreciable influence in determining the number
of servants in cities.</p>

<p>Three illustrations of this are seen: (1) Washington,
Richmond, Atlanta, Memphis, and Nashville rank respectively
as regards per capita wealth, 13, 27, 19, 24, and
41, although they are the five cities that head the list in
the proportion of servants to the total population; (2)
Lowell and Fall River are at the foot of the list as regards
the proportion of servants, but rank 10 and 12 in
per capita wealth; (3) Nashville ranks fifth in the number
of servants and Paterson forty-ninth, while both rank<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
nearly the same in point of wealth.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> There are indeed
many instances where there is apparent connection between
these two conditions, but they seem rather to be
illustrations of the following point:</p>

<p>(8) The prevailing industry of a city, rather than its
population or wealth, determines the number of domestic
employees.</p>

<p>This conclusion seems to follow naturally as a result of
the two previous propositions, but a few other facts in
support of it may be mentioned. In eleven of the fifty
principal cities the proportion of domestic servants to the
total population is smaller than is the proportion in the
states in which they are severally located.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> The leading
occupation in each of these cities is some form of manufacturing,
and in each of them the proportion of persons
engaged in manufacturing processes is larger than, with
few exceptions, in the other cities. This fact explains
the apparent contradiction between this statement and
the one that domestic servants are found in the largest
proportions in the largest cities.</p>

<p>That manufacturing industries tend to decrease the
number of domestic employees in a city is both a cause
and a result. The competition in industry draws women
from domestic service, and at the same time a large part
of the population in a manufacturing city is unable or
does not care to employ large numbers of servants. It
has been seen, however, that several of the manufacturing
cities rank comparatively high in per capita wealth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p>It seems possible in view of the facts stated in this
second group of propositions to draw these conclusions.
In states containing a relatively high urban population it
is possible for wealth to command the services of a large
proportion of persons for work in domestic service. But
in cities where wealth comes into competition with manufacturing
industries the proportion of domestic servants
is small. Where such competition does not exist the proportion
is large. In other words, persons are willing to
enter domestic service for a consideration in cities where
no other avenues of work are open to them with the
qualifications they possess. They are unwilling to do
so where such openings do exist.</p>

<p>A third group of propositions remains to be considered
concerning the subject of wages. They may be thus stated:</p>

<p>(1) Wages in domestic service vary in different sections
according to the economic conditions of the several
localities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<p>This principle is illustrated by Table VII on the
preceding page based on a classification of the returns
received through individual schedules relating to 2,545
employees.</p>

<p>The difference indicated apparently conforms to the
general variation in wages in different sections indicated
by the Fourth Annual Report of the Commissioner of
Labor,<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> and by examination of a considerable number of
reports of various state bureaus of labor. The slight
exception in the case of the wages of men on the Pacific
coast is accidental, owing to the small number of returns.</p>

<p>(2) Skilled labor commands higher wages than unskilled
labor.</p>

<p>This will be evident from Table VIII on the following
page based on the schedules received from employers
and employees and the returns from a Boston employment
bureau.</p>

<p>In every instance it is seen that it is the skilled laborer—the
cook—who commands the highest wages. The
general servant who is expected to unite in herself all the
functions of all the other employees named in the list
becomes, on account of this fact, an unskilled worker,
and, therefore, receives the lowest wages. The same
principle holds true in the case of the seamstress and the
laundress, the gardener and the choreman. It is difficult
to make a deduction in the case of men employed in
household service, since no universal custom prevails, as
with women employees, in regard to adding to the
wages paid in money, board, lodging, and other personal
expenses.</p>

<p>A corollary to the proposition may be added. The
skilled laborer is a better workman than the unskilled
laborer. The question was asked of employers, “What
is the nature of the service rendered? Is it ‘excellent,’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
‘good,’ ‘fair,’ or ‘poor’?” The replies show that in proportion
to the number of answers the largest percentage
of service characterized as “excellent” is rendered by
cooks, while the largest percentage characterized as
“poor” is given by the general servants. These are, it
is true, matters of opinion; and without a fixed standard,
which it is impossible to secure, such judgments can have
no absolute value. But the fact is of interest as showing
the opinion of a large number of housekeepers. The following
table will show the results in regard to these two
classes of employees:</p>

<p>(3) The foreign born in domestic service receive
higher wages than the native born.</p>

<p>This was found to be true in every class of occupations,
in every section, in the case of both men and women, and
in the returns made by both employers and employees.
But two trifling exceptions were found, both accidental.
The principle cannot of course be stated absolutely as
the facts at command are far from exhaustive, but so
striking a uniformity cannot be considered purely accidental.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
An explanation is found in three facts: (1)
the preference of the foreign born for the large cities,
where wages in domestic service are higher than in the
country; (2) the large proportion of negroes among the
native born; (3) the relatively better class of foreign
born than of native born women who enter domestic
service. This statement must be made somewhat dogmatically
here, since its proof demands a discussion of
the entire subject of the unwillingness of native born
women to enter domestic service.</p>

<p>(4) The wages of men engaged in domestic service are
higher than the wages of women.</p>

<p>This will be evident by reference to Table VII and to
Table VIII. Two things, however, must be borne in
mind: first, that nearly all the men classified as cooks are
employed on the Pacific coast, where wages are relatively
high; second, that forty per cent of the men in domestic
service do not receive board and lodging in addition to
wages in money, while only two per cent of women so
employed, principally laundresses, do not receive board
and lodging. But although these facts modify the discrepancy
between the wages of men and women, they do
not wholly remove it. Whether the difference is as great
as in other occupations cannot be stated.</p>

<p>(5) A tendency is found towards an increase in wages
paid by employers, as is seen in Table X on the following
page.</p>

<p>An interesting historical illustration of the same fact
is given in a summary of wages and prices in Massachusetts
from 1752 to 1860. In 1815, the first time the
work of women is mentioned specifically, domestic servants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
received with board $.50 per week, while at the
same time women were able to earn as papermakers
$6.50 a week.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>(6) The wages received in domestic service are relatively
and sometimes absolutely higher than the average
wages received in other wage-earning occupations open
to women.</p>

<p>A comparison may be made between the wages received
by domestic employees and by two other classes—teachers
in representative city schools and the wage-earning women
included in the investigations made by the Commissioner
of Labor. As illustrating the wages received in domestic
service, the following tables are given, showing (1) the
classified weekly and daily wages received and (2) the
average weekly and daily wages with the percentages
receiving more or less than the average. These facts
are taken from the general schedules. Similar tables
are given showing a somewhat higher rate of wages in
all domestic occupations in the special city of Boston.</p>

<p>It is seen from Table XII that the average weekly
wages in domestic service are $3.23—a fair average in
this case, since forty-eight per cent receive more than the
average and fifty-two per cent the same or less than the
average. The average domestic employee, therefore, is able
to earn in money during the year $167.96—a fair estimate,
since in seventy-five cases out of every hundred the vacation
granted women employees during the year is given without
loss of wages.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> This forms, however, but a part of
the annual earnings. To this sum must be added board
and lodging, fuel and light. For the equivalent in
quality and quantity to that furnished by the employer
the employee would in general be obliged to pay for board,
lodging, and other incidental expenses at a reasonable estimate
five dollars per week, or $250 annually, deducting
board for two weeks’ vacation. The total annual earnings
of a domestic employee, therefore, amount to nearly $420.
To this the negative facts must be added that there is no
expense for laundry work, and that the work involves few
personal expenses in the way of clothing, and that these
necessary expenses are often partially met through gifts
from the employer. Again, the position entails no expenditures
for car fares in going to and from work, or
other demands such as are made in a business way by
other occupations, and it involves no outlay for appliances
for work, as a sewing-machine, type-writer, text-books,
etc. Moreover, no investment of capital is necessary
in learning the principles of the work, since employers
have thus far been willing to make of their own
homes training-schools for employees. The domestic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
employee is therefore never obliged to pay back either
the capital invested in preparing for her work or the
interest on that amount. It thus seems possible for the
average household employee to save annually nearly $150
in an occupation involving no outlay or investment of
capital in any way, and few personal expenses.</p>

<p>The concentration of salaries is seen to be on those
between $400 and $500, the average salary being $545.
This sum represents the full amount of wages received.
To ascertain the amount it is possible to save annually
there must be deducted at least $260 for board and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
lodging, and $25 for laundry expenses, leaving a cash
balance of $260. Out of this sum, however, must come
other necessary expenses, as the outfit for work,—books,
stationery, etc.,—travelling expenses, car fares, society
fees, etc., and a large item for clothing. There should
also be deducted the interest on the capital invested in
securing the education demanded in preparation for the
work. If all of these items are considered, and the greater
social demands entailed by the position, it seems possible
for the average domestic employee to save at least as
much money as the average teacher in the city schools.
This comparison is probably relatively higher in favor of
the teacher than it should be, since in the average wages
for domestic employees are included the wages received
in agricultural districts, where wages are lower than in
cities. It is also a comparison between skilled workers
on the one hand, and on the other hand an occupation
in some of the subdivisions of which the laborers are
unskilled.</p>

<p>It has, unfortunately, not been possible to compare the
wages received in the same city by teachers and domestic
employees. A comparison, however, can be made between
the wages received in Boston for domestic service and
by the teachers in the public schools in the neighboring
city of Cambridge.</p>

<p>The average wages received by a cook in a private
family in Boston are, as has been seen by Table XIV,
$4.45. This judgment is based on five hundred and
seventy-four returns, and is an exact average, since fifty
per cent receive more than that amount, and fifty per
cent the same or less than that. She therefore earns<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
annually $231.40 plus $275 for board, lodging, fuel,
light, and laundry expenses, or $506.40.</p>

<p>Fifty-six per cent of the teachers in the city schools
in Cambridge earn annually $620, or, deducting $285 for
board, etc., for fifty-two weeks, $335 in money. This is
$103 more than is received by the Boston cook, but out
of this must come numerous expenses entailed by the
position, from which the domestic employee is exempt.
The cash annual savings in the two cases cannot vary
materially.</p>

<p>It will also be seen by reference to Tables XV and XVI
that the Boston cook earns absolutely more than does the
average city teacher in Albany, Atlanta, Baltimore, New
Orleans, Paterson, Rochester, and Syracuse.</p>

<p>A second comparison is suggested by the investigations
conducted by the Department of Labor. Through these
it was found that the annual cash earnings of the working-women
in twenty-two typical cities are $272.45.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> This
average takes into consideration time lost—a factor
which does not enter into domestic employments except
in a casual way. The annual earnings, therefore, of the
class of women represented by the Report are much less
than those of the domestic employee. The same point is
also illustrated by a comparison of the amounts saved in
the two occupations. In eleven cities investigated by the
Department of Labor the average amount saved was less
than $50; in nine cities it was $50, but under $100, while
in only two cities was it more than $100, the highest
average amount being $111.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> As has been suggested, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
highest of these averages is small in comparison with the
amount it is possible to save in domestic service.</p>

<p>No question in regard to earnings saved was asked on
the schedule sent to employees, but many statements on
this point were voluntarily made by employees.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> The
question as to comparative amounts saved has also been
asked the cashiers of banks in small cities and towns
where factories are found and the personnel of depositors
is known by the officials of the banks. No records are
of course kept, but the opinion has been several times expressed
that the factory employees do not save as much,
as a class, as do domestic employees. In one place, where
about two thousand factory employees are found, it was
stated that no woman employee had a sum to her credit
as large as had been deposited by a domestic.</p>

<p>A corollary follows from this proposition. High wages
alone are not sufficient to counterbalance the inducements
offered in other occupations where wages are relatively
or absolutely lower but whose special advantages are
deemed more desirable.</p>

<p>(7) The wages paid in domestic service are on the
average high, but the occupation offers few opportunities
for advancement in this direction.</p>

<p>An examination of Table XI shows but one instance,
with the exception of nurses, where the weekly cash
wages reach $10.00 per week, and only nine others where
they rise above $7.00. In the two occupations the wages
in which have been compared with those in domestic
service, while the general average wages are low, it is
possible to reach through promotion a comparatively high<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
point. The fact that the wage plane is a high one is one
inducement for women of average ability to enter the
occupation. On the other hand, the fact that the wage
limit, high as it is, is soon reached must act as a barrier
in the case of others.</p>

<p>(8) The amount of time unemployed is less in domestic
service than in nearly every other occupation.</p>

<p>The element of time unemployed is an important factor
in determining annual earnings. While in nearly every
occupation there is a limit to the demand, in domestic
service there is no limit and hence few persons are
necessarily without employment. The most important
illustration of this point is derived from the report of
the Massachusetts Bureau of Statistics of Labor on the
unemployed in that state in 1885.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> Of the total number of
women in the state engaged in remunerative occupations
at the time, thirty per cent were unemployed. These
were distributed as regards occupations as follows:</p>

  <tr>
    <td>Manufacturing industries</td>
    <td class="tdr">78.22</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Government and professional services</td>

  </tr>
</table>

<p>But if the number of unemployed is compared with the
total number employed in each industry, a still lower percentage
of unemployed is found in domestic service. A
comparison with other wage earners will make clear this
point. The percentage of the unemployed in the leading
industries in which women are engaged was as follows:</p>

<p>The demand for domestic servants varies in the different
states, but the condition of the unemployed in this
occupation in Massachusetts may perhaps be considered
fairly typical of that in other localities.</p>

<p>(9) High wages are maintained without the aid of
strikes or combinations on the part of the employees.</p>

<p>In but five states are strikes reported among domestic
employees;<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> they number but twenty-two and involve
less than seven hundred persons, all of them being connected
with hotels or restaurants, and nine tenths of
them men. Only two instances of permanent organization
among this class have come to notice, and neither of
these has had as its object the increase of wages. The
strike in domestic service assumes the form of a “notice,”
is individual in character, and is able to accomplish its
object without the organized effort considered necessary
in other occupations where the supply of laborers is
greater than the demand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<p>This group of nine propositions concerning wages it is
believed will suggest three conclusions: the conformity
of wages in domestic service to certain general economic
laws, the fact that the wage factor alone does not determine
the number of persons in the occupation, and the
existence of a few conditions which affect, perhaps unconsciously,
the willingness of the women to engage in this
work.</p>

<p>The three groups of propositions stated it is believed
will suggest the conclusions that the general economic
condition of the country has an appreciable influence on
the condition of domestic service, both as regards the
character and number of persons engaged and the compensation
given for service required. It must follow
therefore that many questions must arise connected with
the employment, which the individual employer cannot
settle from an exclusively personal point of view.</p>

<span class="smaller">DIFFICULTIES IN DOMESTIC SERVICE FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE EMPLOYER</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The understanding of domestic service has been seen
to involve the consideration of many historical changes
both industrial and political, and an examination of the
general economic laws to which it is amenable. It involves
also a study of the economic conditions that surround
the average family, and the problems that confront
it when undertaking to deal with the question of domestic
service.</p>

<p>The average family reached through the schedules was
found to consist of about five persons,<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> exclusive of servants.
Its members have kept house eighteen years,<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
they have boarded two years and a half,<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> and at some
time during their housekeeping experience they have
been without servants. They employ at the present
time two servants and a half, or rather, they command<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
the full time of two persons and half the time of the
third, to whom they pay weekly for service rendered, on
the basis indicated in the schedule of average wages,
$10,<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> exclusive of board and lodging, or $500 annually,
the expense of service exclusive also of waste,
breakage, and general wear and tear of household
furniture and appliances. In about one third of all the
families with servants men are employed in some capacity
about the house; in one family in every seven the number
of servants is the same as the number of persons in
the family or exceeds it, while in the average family one
servant renders service to every two persons.</p>

<p>When the average family undertakes the task of dealing
with domestic servants the difficulties that confront it
are many and serious.</p>

<p>It has first the task of assimilating into its domestic
life those who are of a different nationality and who consequently
hold different industrial, social, religious and
political beliefs. More than one half of all domestic employees
are of foreign birth or belong to another race,<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
who come not only from the prominent European countries
but also from the remote corners of the globe,<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
where all conditions are totally unlike those of America.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
Moreover this number does not include the very large
percentage of those who are themselves native born, but
who are the children of foreign born parents and have
inherited to a certain extent un-American characteristics;
4.02 per cent of the domestic employees in this country
do not speak the English language.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Those who come to
this country, often with preconceived and erroneous
ideas as to the independence prevailing here, expecting
high wages in return for inexperienced and unskilled
labor,<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> must be trained in all the ways not only of American
life, but of the family of the individual employer.
It has been found difficult to assimilate into our political
system the large foreign element coming here, though
this system is simple and lends itself readily to such
assimilation, as our history has thus far proved. It is
far more difficult to assimilate this mass into the infinitely
more complex and delicate organism—the modern
household. It is not strange that congestion and inflammation
so often result from the attempt. The question
is one also that becomes more difficult as the proportion
of foreign employees increases.</p>

<p>A second difficulty is that of the spirit of restlessness
which everywhere prevails among working classes,
though not confined to them, and the consequent brief
tenure of service. The average length of service of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
domestic servant is found to be less than a year and a
half and this in many cases and in some localities is a
high average. In the East, in the vicinity of the great
lakes, on the Pacific coast, and in some sections of the
South, proximity to popular summer or winter resorts lessens
the average duration of service. In the South, the
cotton-picking season draws many women from household
work, as they are able at that time to earn enough money to
enable them to live for some months in idleness. In other
localities, the hop-picking season, the berry-picking season,
and the grape-picking season all offer temporary inducements
for girls to leave domestic service. In still other
places the canning factory, the pickle factory, and the
fruit-drying establishment successfully offer temporary
competition. To the question asked of employees, “Have
you ever had any other occupation besides domestic service?”
twenty-eight per cent answered “Yes.” This at
first might seem to indicate a decided preference for
domestic service, but a closer examination shows that
more often it means that housework is taken up when the
berry-picking and the fruit-canning season is over, when
the mill or the factory has closed in a dull time or when
the hurry of plantation work is ended at the South. A
similar indication of this restlessness is found in the
replies given by employers to the question, “How many
servants have you employed since you have been housekeeping?”
Twenty-five per cent did not answer the
question definitely and of these one half state as their
reason the fact that the number was too great to remember.
“Their name is legion,” answer fifteen housekeepers,
a series of exclamation points tells the story for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
others, “infinity-minus,” writes one, and still another
bids the compiler “read her answer in the stars.”</p>

<p>This condition of affairs is not to be wondered at.
That spirit of restlessness, nervous discontent, and craving
for excitement which foreigners find characteristic of
all who breathe American air is not confined to business
men and society women—it permeates the kitchen, the
nursery, the laundry, and every part of the household.
Among employers the mode of life tends more and more
towards a winter in California, a summer in Europe, an
autumn in the mountains, and a spring in Florida. On
both sides of the Hudson there are magnificent country
houses deserted because their owners prefer the excitement
of city life, the attractions of Bar Harbor, or the
society at Newport. The towns on the Hudson are
nearly stationary as regards population, though possessing
every natural advantage, while the large cities are
powerful magnets drawing from every direction. Domestic
service cannot remain unaffected by these characteristics
of the age. A new situation is often like a voyage
to Europe so desired by others—it gives change, excitement,
new experiences, and it is often the only way in
which these can be secured. A summer engagement at
the sea-shore, among the mountains, or at the springs is
often as eagerly sought as is the height of the season at
Saratoga or among the Berkshires by persons whose
opportunities for change are far less restricted. The
occupations temporarily open at the time of the hop-picking
season, or the fruit-canning season, offer the
attraction of large numbers of fellow-workers in the
company of whom “a good time” is expected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p>The tenure of service also apparently varies somewhat
with the size of the place, the average duration being
longer in cities of from ten thousand to eighty thousand
inhabitants than in smaller towns or larger cities. In
small towns the desire for city life shortens the terms of
service. In the largest cities, as New York, Brooklyn,
Boston, Philadelphia, the average time is shortened by
the fact that employers are often obliged to engage as a
temporary expedient persons who have just arrived in
this country; while it is also seen to be true that there
is greater difficulty than in small cities in obtaining
reliable testimonials.</p>

<p>It is not strange, therefore, that reasonable, intelligent,
and competent employers have difficulties to meet that
lie entirely without the domain of their own households,
and that many persons who twenty-five years ago experienced
no difficulty whatever find to-day serious trouble
in retaining their employees.</p>

<p>A third difficulty is the fact that employers are so
often obliged to engage for skilled labor the assistance of
unskilled laborers. Many who seek employment as servants
do not know even the names of the household tools
they are obliged to use—still less are they acquainted with
their uses. A part of this ignorance and lack of skill is
due to the prevalence of the old idea that anybody can
do everything—a theory abandoned in most occupations
but still dominating the household. Household employments
and service are still generally considered occupations
that any one can “pick up,” but the picking-up
process has resulted in the household, as elsewhere, in
unscientific, haphazard work and has seldom produced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
expert workmen. The Superintendent of the Census
wrote in 1880, “The organization of domestic service in
the United States is so crude that no distinction whatever
can be successfully maintained (between the different
parts of the service).”<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> In confirmation of this statement
is the testimony of a large number of employees to the
effect that they have become domestic servants because
they had not education enough to do anything else.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
From this general conception of the nature of household
service several things result: first, few opportunities
exist for learning household duties in a systematic way;
second, if the opportunities were created, few would avail
themselves of them so long as this low estimate of the
occupation prevails; third, many housekeepers are obliged
to conduct in their own households a training-school on
a limited scale; fourth, the expense is far greater than
it should be, since unskilled labor is always improvident
of time and materials;<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> fifth, the hygienic results of “instinctive
cookery” and “picked up” knowledge are often
seen in ill health and a derangement of household affairs
erroneously attributed to other causes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<p>A fourth difficulty arises when the seemingly inevitable
annual change of employees comes. Four courses
are open to the housekeeper: (1) she may employ a
new servant without asking for a recommendation,
(2) she may take the recommendation of previous employers,
(3) she may consult an employment bureau,
(4) she may advertise.</p>

<p>Few persons are willing to adopt the first expedient
and take a stranger into their service, not to speak of
their family life, without some recommendation.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>But the second course open—taking the recommendation
of others—is scarcely more practicable. There
must always be a difference in standards, and “excellent”
to one may mean “fair” or even “poor” to another.
It is also true that an employee may succeed
in one place and be ill adapted to meet the requirements
of another. Again, it is a common complaint that the
recommendation does not always carry with it implicit
confidence in its contents. Daniel DeFoe wrote nearly
two hundred years ago:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“One of the great Evils, which lies heavily upon Families now, in
this particular Case of taking Servants, is the going about from
House to House, to take Characters and Reports of Servants, or by
Word of Mouth; and especially among the Ladies this Usage prevails,
in which the good Nature and Charity of the Ladies to ungrateful
Servants, goes so far beyond their Justice to one another,
that an ill Servant is very seldom detected, and the Ladies yet excuse
themselves by this, <i>namely</i>, that they are loth to take away a poor
Servant’s Good Name, which is starving them; and that they may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
perhaps mend, when they come to another Family, what was amiss
before, which indeed seldom happens.... The Ladies are cheating
and abusing one another, in Charity to their <i>Servants</i>. It is Time to
put an End to this unreasonable Good nature.”<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These words are as true a description of this phase
of the subject in America to-day as they were in England
at the beginning of the last century. It seems
impossible to devise any system of personal recommendations
that will convey the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth.</p>

<p>The third expedient—the employment bureau—is
apparently coming into general use, especially in the
large cities where some means of communication is necessary
between those desiring employees and employment.
But it is in the large city, where the greatest
need for it exists, that the employment bureau is most
unsatisfactory. The bureau lives by the fees paid to
it by those desiring help and those seeking employment.
Every expedient, therefore, is used to extort fees from
both classes, and it is difficult to tell which suffers more
from this extortion. Even when numberless fees have
been paid, the employer too often finds himself without
the service to which his fee presumably entitles him.
The first department abandoned by a large philanthropic
institution in Boston, was the intelligence
office, “because it was found impossible to supply well-trained
servants while there was no demand for any
other.”<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> But the greatest objection to the intelligence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
office is that it is often a breeding place for vice and
crime. An investigation recently made of the intelligence
offices in a large city showed that it supported
one hundred and twenty, two thirds of them controlled
by foreigners, many of them managed by minor ward
politicians, and four of them under police supervision.
The employees that can be found through such agencies
are not those willingly received into a respectable family.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>
Employment bureaus in small cities are apparently more
satisfactory than those in large ones, while those offices
are to be commended which use printed forms for obtaining
statements from previous employers as to the
qualifications of applicants.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> Those agencies patronized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
by an inferior class of employers and employees, especially
those that are at no pains to secure recommendation
of employees from respectable persons, are worse
than useless.</p>

<p>Employers who adopt the fourth policy and advertise
for help are forced to open an intelligence office on a
small scale in their own homes.</p>

<p>All of these difficulties are so great, especially that of
securing reliable testimony from responsible employers,
that many persons tolerate incompetent service rather
than incur the risk of a change for the worse.</p>

<p>A fifth difficulty encountered by the employers of
domestic service, and probably the most serious of all,
is the prevailing indifference among housekeepers to the
action of economic law—a failure to realize that in domestic
service, as in other occupations, the course followed
by one employer has an appreciable effect on the condition
of service as a whole. This can be best explained by a few
concrete illustrations “drawn from life.”</p>

<p>Mr. A, an employer, leaves his city home during the
summer, retaining in it two servants to care for the
house and paying them their usual wages, $16 a month.
No special service is required of them, but wages are
paid in consideration of the tacit understanding that
they are to remain in his employ. On the return of
Mr. A, Mr. X, who has discharged his servants during
the summer, offers the employees of Mr. A $18 a month.
This price he can afford to pay since he has been at no
expense for service during the summer. Mr. A, rather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
than lose his trusted employees, pays them the advance
offered by Mr. X, although the services of neither employee
are worth more than three months previous.</p>

<p>Mrs. B, an employer of limited means, with a natural
gift for cooking considered as a fine art, takes an inexperienced
girl from Castle Garden and teaches her after
long training something of her own skill. She pays fair
wages, which are considered entirely satisfactory by the
employee in view of the instruction she has received.
Mrs. Y, who ignores Mrs. B socially and is indifferent
to the matter of wages, calls on Mrs. B’s cook and offers
her $5 per week. This is much above the current rate
of wages in the place and moreover Mrs. B cannot afford
to pay it. She therefore loses her trained cook.</p>

<p>Mr. C, an employer in haste to reach his distant home
and anxious to secure a servant, engages in the afternoon
a Swedish girl who has that morning landed in America
and of whom he knows nothing. She is to accompany
his family, which includes five children, to their Western
home, have all of her expenses of travel paid by her
employers, and receive $4.00 a week for her services as a
nurse-maid.</p>

<p>Mrs. D, a housekeeper with a large family, moderate
income, and ambitious tastes, employs one general servant
and requires, in addition to the ordinary duties
of such a servant, dining-room and chamber service.</p>

<p>Mrs. E, her nearest neighbor, a housekeeper with a
small family, simple tastes, and free from numerous
social demands, makes all of the desserts herself, requires
no table service of her employee, and expects her
daughter to assume the care of the chambers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. F pays full wages to her inexperienced “help,”
fifteen years old, because the latter has an invalid mother
dependent on her.</p>

<p>Mr. G, with a family of two, prides himself on paying
the highest wages in the place to his cook, second girl,
and coachman.</p>

<p>Mrs. H, who has inherited a large family homestead,
which she occupies with her sister, provides her three
employees each with a separate bedroom, a special
dining-room, a sitting-room well furnished, and grants
many personal privileges, as the use of the horse and
carriage for early church. She does not understand how
any housekeeper can have trouble in securing and retaining
competent employees. She often quotes to her nearest
neighbor, “A good mistress makes a good servant,” her
neighbor being obliged to use her back parlor with a
mantel bed as a guest-room and therefore to limit somewhat
the accommodations granted her employees.</p>

<p>Mrs. I gives each of her employees a key to the side
door and makes no inquiries as to the hours they keep.</p>

<p>Mrs. J gives her servants her discarded evening
dresses because “it keeps them in good humor.”</p>

<p>Mrs. K, the wife of a millionaire, “burns all of her
old finery,” and makes it a special point to teach all of
her twelve employees how to dress well and economically
within the wages they receive.</p>

<p>Mrs. L does not permit her employee to wear frizzes
or bangs, disapproves of her having company, and will
not tolerate a young man caller under any circumstances.</p>

<p>Mrs. M, a lifelong invalid whose physician has prescribed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
absolute rest two hours every afternoon, reasons
that her employee who rises two hours earlier than herself
must need the same rest and therefore sends her
every afternoon to take a nap. The latter thus never
works afternoons and is able to attend more evening
entertainments than other employees in the neighborhood.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>Mrs. N assists her husband in his business six hours
each day and gives her employee full control of the
house during her absence.</p>

<p>Mrs. O requires all her employees to perform their
work according to minute directions laid down by herself
and is constantly present to see that these are not
deviated from in the slightest degree.</p>

<p>Mrs. P discharges her nursery maid for untruthfulness
and gives her a recommendation testifying to her neatness,
quickness, pleasant disposition, and fondness for
children.</p>

<p>Mr. Q discharges his butler for incapacity, but in
view of the fact that the latter has a widowed mother
and an invalid sister dependent on him gives him an
excellent recommendation.</p>

<p>Mr. R discharges his housekeeper “for infirmity of
temper,” as he subsequently testifies in court, but gives
her so excellent a recommendation that she believes she
has been discharged for physical disability, and gives her
testimony to this effect in the same lawsuit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. S has a cook who drinks to excess one fourth of
the time, but the latter has no fear of dismissal because
three fourths of the time she cooks in a superior manner.</p>

<p>Mrs. T dislikes manual labor of every kind. Her
servants therefore know that she will tolerate inefficient
and incompetent service rather than be left for a single
day without help.</p>

<p>Mr. U, the father of three young sons, has a coachman
who swears like a trooper, but he retains him because
Mrs. U considers him the most stylish coachman
in the city.</p>

<p>Mrs. V applies to an employment bureau for a domestic
and refuses six applicants because they are not “pretty”
and “refined.” After finding one whose appearances are
satisfactory, she parts with her because she is unwilling
to black the gentlemen’s boots.</p>

<p>Mrs. W engages a woman to go out of town for
service, the latter to wait a week before going and meantime
to pay her own board. At the time agreed upon
she reaches the employer’s house, to learn that the former
“help” has decided to remain. She has thus lost a
week’s board and wages and more than two dollars in
going and returning to the city, and all of “her set”
refuse to make engagements in the country.</p>

<p>The different economic, social, and moral questions
connected with these various conditions, the illustrations
of which could be multiplied indefinitely, may be, generally
are, decided by each individual without reference to
society at large. Wages are too often regulated by the
employer’s bank account, hours of service by his caprice,
and moral questions by his personal convenience. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
employer is too often the autocrat in his own home. He
considers that neither his neighbor nor the general public
has any more concern in the business relations existing
between himself and his domestic employees than it has
in the price he pays for a dinner service or in the color
and cut of his coat.</p>

<p>Yet domestic service is the only employment in which
economic laws are so openly defied and all questions
connected with it settled on the personal basis. No
manufacturer can from charitable motives double the
wages ordinarily paid to unskilled labor without being
called to account for it by competing manufacturers, nor
can he reduce unduly the wages of his employees without
being held responsible for his course by the employees of
other establishments, nor can he prolong by one fourth of
an hour the daily period of labor without overstepping
his legal privileges. Within certain narrow limits he
has freedom, but competition, labor organizations, and
the arm of the law combine to keep him within these
limits. Before domestic service is freed from all the
difficulties that attend it there must be a more widespread
recognition of the responsibility of the individual
employer to those outside his own household.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>Five general classes of perplexing conditions have been
suggested. All of them are independent of the personal
characteristics and habits of employer and employee and
of the personal relationship that exists between them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
They do not take into account the fact that throughout
the South and wherever negroes are employed in the
household the housekeeper must be ever on the alert to
guard against dishonesty and immorality on the part of
these employees, that intemperance has been found a besetting
sin of cooks and coachmen irrespective of race and
nationality, that many agree with Mr. Joseph Jefferson
when he says, “I am satisfied that domestic melancholy
sets in with the butler. He is the melodramatic villain
of society.” They do not consider the tendencies encountered
here as elsewhere towards indifference, idleness,
laziness, low ideals and standards, insubordination,
and a desire to obtain much for nothing.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> They do not
include lack of harmony in the personal relations between
employees in the same household,<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> the constant friction
that necessarily arises from the presence of a stranger in
the family, the question of compatibility of disposition
between the mistress and the maid, the feeling between
employees and the children of the household. They are
as prone to trouble a good mistress as a poor one, they are
independent of knowledge of household affairs, of housekeeping
experience, of good or ill treatment of employees,
of any personal element whatever in employer or employee.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
They are difficulties apparently inherent in the
present system of domestic service.</p>

<p>It is of interest to note the opinion of housekeepers on
this point. The question, “Have you found it difficult
to secure good domestic servants?” was answered with
the following result:</p>

<p>Fifty-seven per cent therefore of the housekeepers represented
by the schedules have found more or less difficulty
in securing good servants. This is, probably, an
underestimate of the true condition. Many housekeepers
who see only the personal element involved in the employment
of service consider an acknowledgment of difficulty
a confession of weakness and inability on their own
part to cope with the question and are therefore silent.
Others have had the experience of one who writes, “I
have had no difficulty, my cook having been with me
eighteen years, and my second girl, her daughter, ten
years. But if they should leave I should not know where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
to turn.” Again, the replies do not represent the experiences
of a class not represented on the schedules—the
many in the large cities who are able to employ servants
only occasionally and find them through the lowest grade
of intelligence offices.</p>

<p>These difficulties are certainly not decreasing,<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> and the
demand for competent servants is in most places evidently
greater than the supply.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> These difficulties are, at times,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
somewhat modified by the conditions in which the employer
is placed. They are apparently less in large cities
that are ports of entry or the termini of leading railroad
lines, and have comparatively few manufacturing industries
in which women are employed; they are less in
small families employing a large number of servants and
paying high wages. But even all of these favorable conditions
only modify—they do not change—the nature of
the question.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> A careful study of the returned schedules
with reference to the location, population, and prevailing
industry of the towns, the number of servants employed,
size of family, and wages paid leads to this conclusion.
Of the five hundred and forty-five employers who reported<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
that they had difficulty in securing competent servants,
only twenty-six gave in explanation a reason that
would not have been applicable in any city, town, or village
in the country, and those twenty-six had reference to
the negroes at the South and the Chinese at the West.
One half of the employees reporting state that they would
go into another occupation provided it would pay them
as well,<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> although the number is very small of those who
are dissatisfied except with the disadvantages of the position.
If these difficulties are found in every place irrespective
of its size, its geographical location, its prevailing
industry, the character of its inhabitants, and the personal
relations of mistress and maid, something more is involved
for the employer than “kind treatment” and personal consideration.</p>

<p>The belief has apparently been general that these perplexities
are confined to our own country and that the
adoption of English or German or French methods of
dealing with the subject would remove them all. The
question is undoubtedly a less difficult one in England
than it is in this country, since it is not complicated by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
differences of race, religion, interests, and traditions, by
foreign immigration, and possibly not by the same ease
with which labor is transferred from one employment to
another, while tradition and social custom have favored
country rather than city life and have thus eliminated
one of our difficulties. But with all these obstacles
removed, DeFoe’s <i>Behaviour of Servants</i> shows that even
in England the question is an old one, and current literature
indicates that it is far from settled.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>If the question is asked in Germany, “Is it easy to
secure good domestic servants here?” the almost invariable
answer is, “It is very difficult, almost impossible.”
The reasons for the difficulty are precisely the same as in
America—the attractions of city life, the competition of
shops and factories, the growth of democratic ideas, the
difficulty of securing, in spite of the system of service
books, unimpeachable recommendations, and the spirit of
restlessness that everywhere prevails among the working
classes. In some of the higher classes, where something
of the old patriarchal relationship between mistress and
maid still exists, there is apparently no difficulty; but
each year these classes become more and more undermined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
by the social democratic spirit, and must in time
be affected by the same conditions that bring perplexity
to other classes. Yet it is true in Germany as in America
that servants seeking places are always to be found,
that intelligence offices are crowded with applicants for
work, and that an army of incompetents is always at
hand.</p>

<p>In France the problem is the same. It varies in details;
the proportion of men employed in housework is
far greater than in America, England, or Germany, servility
of manner is not expected as in England, and waste
of material is less common than in America. But fundamentally
the conditions are the same as elsewhere.</p>

<p>The difficulties that meet the employer of domestic
labor both in America and in Europe are the difficulties
that arise from the attempt to harmonize an ancient,
patriarchal industrial system with the conditions of
modern life. Everywhere the employer closes his eyes
to the incongruities of the attempt and lays the blame of
failure, not to a defective system, but to the natural
weaknesses in the character of the unfortunate persons
obliged to carry it out. The difficulties in the path of
both employer and employee will not only never be removed
but will increase until the subject of domestic
service is regarded as a part of the great labor question
of the day and given the same serious consideration.</p>

<span class="smaller">ADVANTAGES IN DOMESTIC SERVICE</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The question as to who constitute the class of domestic
employees has been partially answered. One fourth
are of foreign birth or belong to a different race from
that of their employers, the majority are of foreign birth,
of foreign parentage, or of a different race. Nearly one
third of the number represented on the schedules have
been engaged in other occupations besides domestic service—a
fact indicating three things: first, the spirit of
restlessness that characterizes the class, though not
peculiar to it; second, the industrial independence of a
considerable number of domestic employees, since they
can at any time change not only employers but employment;<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
third, the fact that many do not enter domestic
service with the thought of making it a permanent occupation.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
About two thirds of those who have had other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
work report that they received higher wages in these
occupations than in domestic service. In nearly every
case, however, these represented the cash weekly or
monthly wages received, not the yearly earnings, nor did
they include the factor of personal expenses as in domestic
service.</p>

<p>The reasons why women have entered domestic service
are many and various. The following classification has
been made of the reasons assigned by the employees
returning the schedules:</p>

<p>These reasons and others demand a more detailed
examination. It is true in domestic service, as in other
occupations, that many drift into it because it is apparently
the only course open to them, but there are certain
advantages and disadvantages which a person who is free
to choose always weighs before deciding for or against
the occupation.</p>

<p>The most obvious advantage is that of high<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
remuneration,<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> including not only wages and expenses, but as has
been seen, the factors of steady employment, certainty of
position, and the fact that no capital is required at any
stage of the work or in preparation for it.</p>

<p>A second advantage is that the occupation is conducive
to good health, including as it does regularity and variety
of work, and involving no personal inconvenience or
discomfort.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> In one third of the families considered men
servants are employed in some capacity, and this means
that much of the hard work is done by them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<p>A third advantage is the fact that it gives at least the
externals of a home. This consideration weighs especially
with the foreign born and those who have no
homes of their own.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> How varied and numerous these
home privileges are is best illustrated by the replies
given by employers to the question, “Do you grant any
special privileges?” Thirty answered “No,” and one
hundred and seventy-five gave no answer. Eight hundred
enumerated special privileges, and these formed sixty-eight
different classes. The most important of these are single
rooms, medical care and attendance when sick, use of
daily papers, books, and magazines, evening instruction,
sitting-room for visitors, no restrictions as to visitors,
use of bath-room and sewing-machine, use of horse and
carriage when distant from church, seat at table except
when guests are present, seat in church, and concert and
theatre tickets (in the families of newspaper reporters).
Many other privileges are mentioned,—these are the
most frequently granted. Seventy per cent of the employers
state that they give a single room, but about one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
half of this number employ only one domestic. In many
cases a large room is given for every two domestics, with
separate furniture for each. One hundred and forty-six
specify the use of the dining-room, and ninety-four families
give the use of a special sitting-room. All of these
privileges show that even if the employee is not a member
of the family, her life is as much a part of it, with
the single exception of a seat at the family table, as is
that of the average boarder.</p>

<p>This enumeration of privileges does not include two
other classes which have in a sense ceased to be regarded
as such, but rather as prerogatives of the position. These
are freedom from work at specified times each week and
a stated vacation during the year with or without wages.</p>

<p>The matter of free hours at stated times each week is
apparently a simple one—there is at first thought more
uniformity here among housekeepers than in regard to
any other thing; but while only three per cent of the
employers do not give some specified time during the
week, there are one hundred and twenty-three classes of
combinations which housekeepers have found it possible
to make out of the seven afternoons and seven evenings
of the week, thus apparently disproving the common belief
that the custom is universal of granting Thursday
afternoon and Sunday evening. In sixty-eight of these
classes one or more afternoons are included and in fifteen
others some portion of Sunday. In the case of more than
one thousand employees at least one afternoon each week
is given, while more than four hundred employers give a
part of Sunday.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>The question in regard to vacation granted during the
year was answered with reference to nearly a thousand
employees, and in only one case was a vacation not given,
the time varying from the legal holidays, which perhaps
can hardly be called a vacation, to three months. Sixty-five
per cent of employers give a vacation of from one
week to three months, twenty per cent one or two weeks,
fifteen per cent less than a week, and twenty per cent give
a vacation but do not specify the length of time. These
facts apply to women employees. In the case of men the
conditions are not materially different, the facts given
indicating apparently a smaller per cent among women
receiving a vacation of more than two weeks and a larger
per cent receiving less than a week. In the great majority
of cases this vacation is given without loss of wages.
Tables XVII and XVIII illustrate these facts.</p>

<p>A short vacation granted during the year without loss
of wages has in many localities come to be regarded by
employees as one of the prerogatives of the occupation,
and not, as formerly, a special privilege given. All things
considered, it is a matter of surprise that so much rather
than that so little time is given. In other occupations a
vacation can be granted employees during a dull season
without loss to the employer. But the household machinery
cannot stop action without disaster. A vacation given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
household employees means that the employer must perform
a double amount of domestic work, or provide for special
assistance—often a difficult and even impossible task.</p>

<p>A fourth advantage that domestic service has as an
occupation is the knowledge it gives of household affairs
and the training in them—knowledge of which every
woman, whatever her station in life and whether married
or unmarried, has at times most pressing need.<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>A fifth consideration is that it offers congenial employment
to many whose tastes lie specially in this direction.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>
It is undoubtedly true that many persons in other occupations
would honestly prefer housework if some of its
present disadvantages could be eliminated.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<p>Still another advantage is the legal protection offered
domestic employees, although as Mr. James Schouler well
says, the relation of master and servant is in theory hostile
to the genius of free institutions, since it bears the marks
of social caste. “It may be pronounced as a relation of
more general importance in ancient than in modern times
and better applicable at this day to English than to
American society.”<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> But technically, the relation according
to Chancellor Kent is a legal status resting entirely
on contract. One agrees to work and the other to pay,
but both are on an equality as far as rights are concerned.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>
The legal rights accorded a servant are freedom
from physical punishment,<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> proper food and support in
illness or disability during the time of employment,<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
the right to the enjoyment of a good character—provided
she has one—and the law presumes she has it
until the contrary appears,<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> wages, if the servant has performed
his part of the contract,<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> and damages in case of
discharge before the expiration of the contract.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>These advantages which domestic service as an occupation
has over most other employments are patent. They
would be recognized by all, whether domestic employees
or not, as the accompaniments of the service as it exists
under reasonably favorable conditions. They are advantages<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
which, with the exception of the home privileges,
are independent of the personal character and disposition
of employers. They are apparently inherent in the occupation,
as much to be expected as are free Sundays
and evenings after six o’clock in mills and factories.
They are the inducements which, when a choice has
been possible, have led intelligent women to become
household employees. They are the advantages that
have been repeatedly set forth by the press and the
pulpit to sewing-women and shop-girls working at the
starvation limit of wages in large cities to induce them
to better their condition. Unquestionably many such
women would be far better off than they are now if
they were in comfortable domestic service. It has been
said by the head of one of our great labor bureaus that
all questions concerning wage-earning women resolve
themselves into those of “wages, hours, health, and
morals,” and domestic service conforms to all the requirements
that could be demanded under these four heads,
with the possible exception of hours under unfavorable
conditions. But, notwithstanding these advantages,
women in cities still prefer sewing, country girls drift
into mills and factories, teachers’ agencies are crowded
with applicants who can never secure a position and
could not fill one if obtained; there must be something
else involved in the question besides the matter of
“wages, hours, health, and morals.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE INDUSTRIAL DISADVANTAGES OF DOMESTIC SERVICE</span></h2>

</div>

<p>No one occupation includes every advantage and no
disadvantages. There must always be a balancing of
the pros and cons, and domestic service has its industrial
disadvantages, which are as patent as its advantages, and
like them are independent of the personal relationship
existing between the employer and the employee.</p>

<p>Some of these and other reasons demand a more detailed
explanation.</p>

<p>The first industrial disadvantage is the fact that there
is little or no opportunity for promotion in the service
nor are there opening out from it kindred occupations.
An ambitious and capable seamstress becomes a dressmaker
and mistress of a shop, a successful clerk sets up
a small fancy store, the trained nurse by further study
develops into a physician, the teacher becomes the head
of a school; but there are no similar openings in household
employments. Success means a slight increase in
wages, possibly an easier place, or service in a more
aristocratic neighborhood, but the differences are only
slight ones of degree, never those of kind. “Once a
cook, always a cook” may be applied in principle to every
branch of the service. The only place where promotion
is in any way possible is in hotel service.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> Those women
who would become the most efficient domestics are the ones
who see most clearly this drawback to the occupation.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span></p>

<p>The second disadvantage is the paradoxical one that it
is possible for a capable woman to reach in this employment
comparative perfection in a reasonably short time.
Table service is a fine art which many waitresses never
learn, but it is easily mastered by one who “mixes it
with brains.” One illustration of this is the superior
service given at summer resorts by college students without
special training. The proper care of a room is understood
by few maids, but the comprehension of a few
simple principles enables an intelligent woman soon to
become an expert. The work of a cook involves much
more, but because many persons cook for years without
learning how to provide a single palatable and nourishing
dish, it does not follow that the art cannot be readily
acquired. This fact taken in connection with the previous
one unconsciously operates to prevent a large
number of ambitious women from becoming domestics.</p>

<p>A third disadvantage is the fact that “housework is
never done.” In no other occupation involving the same
amount of intelligent work do the results seem so literally
ephemeral. This indeed is not the true statement of the
case—mistresses are learning slowly that cooking is a
moral and scientific question, that neatness in caring for
a room is a matter of hygiene, and that table service has
æsthetic possibilities. But if it has taken long for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
most intelligent part of society to understand that the
results of housework are not transient, but as far-reaching
in their effects as are the products of any other form of
labor, it cannot be deemed strange that domestics as a
class and those in other occupations complain “in housework
there’s nothing to show for your work.”</p>

<p>A fourth disadvantage is the lack of organization in
domestic work. The verdict from the standpoint of the
statistician has been quoted.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> A domestic employee sums
up the question from her point of view when she says,
“Most women like to follow one particular branch of
industry, such as cooking, or chamber work, or laundry
work, because it enables one to be thorough and experienced;
but when these are combined, as a general thing
the work is hard and never done.”</p>

<p>A fifth disadvantage is the irregularity of working
hours. This is a most serious one, since the question is
complicated not only by the irregularity that exists in
every family, but also by the varying customs in different
families. The actual working hours of a general servant
may vary from one instance of five hours in Kansas to
another of eighteen hours in Georgia. They sometimes
vary in the same city from seven to seventeen hours. It
is a difficult matter to ascertain with the utmost definiteness,
but a careful examination of all statements made
seems to show that the actual working hours are ten in
the case of thirty-eight per cent of women employees,
thirty-seven per cent averaging more than ten hours, and
twenty-five per cent less than this. The working hours
for men average somewhat longer than the hours for
women, while there are slight differences in the various
classes of servants; but they are of too indefinite a character
to be specially noted. Table XIX will illustrate
these points.</p>

<p>Many of these differences are inherent in the composition
of the family, and can never be removed; many of
them are accidental and their number could be lessened
were employers so inclined; many of them grow out of
necessarily differing standards of living. This is seen
where one family of ten employs one general servant and
another family of ten employs eleven servants; one
family of four employs nine servants, while seventy-eight
other families of the same size each employ only one servant;
one family of eight has sixteen servants, while each
one of eight other families consisting of eight persons
employs one servant; twenty-three families numbering
seven each have one general servant, while another family
of seven has thirteen employees; in another instance,
three employees serve a family of one. These contrasts
could be multiplied indefinitely. They simply indicate
in one way the hopeless confusion that must exist at
present in the matter of hours of service required. The
irregularities in even a well-regulated family are always
great. Many of these are apparently necessary, and the
employee must expect to meet them—they are often not
so great as those that perplex the mistress of the house in
her share of the household duties, but the fact cannot be
ignored that they exist and have weight. The one afternoon
each week with generally one or more evenings after
work is done is not sufficient compensation.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> It is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
irregularity in the distribution of working time rather
than the amount of time demanded that causes dissatisfaction
on the part of employees. No complaint is more
often made than this, and the results of the investigation
seem to justify the complaint. To a young woman therefore
seeking employment the question of working hours
assumes the aspect of a lottery—she may draw a prize
of seven working hours or she may draw a blank of fourteen
working hours; she cannot be blamed for making
definite inquiries of a prospective employer regarding
the size of the family and the number of other servants
employed.</p>

<p>A sixth disadvantage closely connected with the preceding
is the matter of free time evenings and Sundays.
This objection to housework is frequently made;<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> it is
one that can never be wholly obviated, since the household
machinery cannot stop at six o’clock and must be kept in
order seven days in the week, but were society so inclined
the objection could be lessened.</p>

<p>A seventh difficulty is presented to the American born<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
girl when she realizes that she must come into competition
with the foreign born and colored element.<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> Although
much of this feeling is undoubtedly unreasonable,
it is not peculiar to domestic service. The fact must be
accepted, with or without excuse for it.</p>

<p>Another disadvantage that weighs with many is the
feeling that in other occupations there is more personal
independence. This includes not only the matter of time
evenings and Sundays, which they can seldom call unconditionally
their own, but there is a dislike of interference
on the part of the employer, either with their work or
with their personal habits and tastes. This interference
is often hard to bear when the employer is an experienced
housekeeper—it is intolerable in the case of an inexperienced
one. The “boss” carpenter who himself knew
nothing about the carpenter’s trade would soon have all
his workmen arrayed against him; in every occupation
an employee is unwilling to be directed except by his
superior in knowledge and ability.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> It seems unreasonable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
to expect domestic service to be an exception to this
universal rule. But even experienced housekeepers often
do not realize how difficult it is for one person to work
in the harness of another, and by insisting on having
work done in their own way, even by competent servants,
they sometimes unconsciously hinder the accomplishment
of their own ends.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> There is also connected with this the
preference for serving a company or a corporation rather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
than a private individual. It is hard to explain this feeling
except on general grounds of prejudice, but the
belief undoubtedly exists that there is more personal independence
connected with work in a large establishment
than there in serving an individual. There is often a
similar feeling of independence in working in families
employing a large number of servants, or in those occupying
a high station in life.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>The industrial disadvantages of the occupation are best
summed up by a young factory operative who was for a
time in domestic service. In answer to the question,
“Why do girls dislike domestic service?” she writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In the first place, I don’t like the idea of only one evening a week
and every other Sunday. I like to feel that I have just so many
hours’ work to do and do them, and come home and dress up and
go out or sit down and sew if I feel like it, and when a girl is in service
she has very little time for herself, she is a servant. In the second
place, a shop or factory girl knows just what she has to do and can go
ahead and do it. I also think going out makes a girl stupid in time.
She gets out of style, so to speak. She never reads and does not know
what is going on in the world. I don’t mean to say they all get stupid,
but it makes gossips of girls that if they worked in shops or factories
would be smart girls. Then I think shop or factory girls make
the best wives. Now I don’t mean all, but the biggest part of them,
and the cleanest housekeepers. The domestic after she gets married
gets careless. She don’t take the pride in her home that the shop-girl
does. She has lived in such fine houses that her small tenement has
no beauty for her after the first glow of married life is over. She
don’t try either to make her home attractive or herself, and gets discouraged,
and is apt to make a man disheartened with her, and then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
I think she is extravagant. She has so much to do with before she is
married and so little to do with after she don’t know how to manage.
She can’t have tenderloin steak for her breakfast and rump roast for
her dinner, and pay the rent and all other bills out of $12 a week—and
that is the average man’s pay, the kind of man we girls that work
for a living get. Of course I don’t mean to say the domestics don’t
have a good time, they do; some of them have lovely places and lay up
money, but after all, what is life if a body is always trying to see just
how much money he or she can save?”</p>

</div>

<p>The industrial disadvantages of the occupation certainly
are many, including as they do the lack of all
opportunity for promotion, the great amount of mere
mechanical repetition involved, the lack of organization
in the service, irregularity in working hours, the limitation
of free time evenings and Sundays, competition with
the foreign born and the negro element that seems objectionable
to the American born, and the interference with
work often by those less skilled than the workers themselves.
The industrial disadvantages, however, form but
one class of the two that weigh most seriously against the
occupation. The social disadvantages will be discussed
in the following chapter.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE SOCIAL DISADVANTAGES OF DOMESTIC SERVICE</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The most serious disadvantage in domestic service that
remains to be considered is the low social position the
employment entails at the present time on those who
enter it. This shows itself in various ways. The most
noticeable is the lack of home privileges. It is true that
the domestic employee receives board, lodging, protection,
and many incidental privileges in the home of her employer;
that these are as a rule better than she could provide
for herself elsewhere, and much superior to those
which can be secured by women working in shops and
factories. But board and lodging do not constitute a
home, and the domestic can never be a part of the family
whose external life she shares. The case is well stated
by an employee who writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Ladies wonder how their girls can complain of loneliness in a
house full of people, but oh! it is the worst kind of loneliness—their
share is but the work of the house, they do not share in the pleasures
and delights of a home. One must remember that there is a difference
between a <i>house</i>, a place of shelter, and a <i>home</i>, a place where all
your affections are centred. Real love exists between my employer
and myself, yet at times I grow almost desperate from the sense of
being cut off from those pleasures to which I had always been accustomed.
I belong to the same church as my employer, yet have no
share in the social life of the church.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<p>This appreciation of the difference between being in a
family and being a part of it is in direct ratio to the delicacy
and sensitiveness of the organization of the employee.
An American who can be considered one of the
family is the very one who most appreciates the difference
between being one of the family and like one of the
family. The differences which are most keenly felt are
three. The first is the fact that a certain amount of
regulation must always be exercised by the employer in
regard to the number and character of visitors received
by the employee. It is a matter of self-protection, and is
sometimes due to the employee as well. It often does
not differ in kind or in degree from the care exercised for
the other members of the household. The necessity for
it is recognized by the better class of employees.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> Nevertheless
the restraint is irksome, the desire for independence
not always unreasonable, and the wish for a place in
which to receive visitors not surprising.</p>

<p>Another deprivation is the lack of opportunity for receiving
or showing in even a slight degree that hospitality
which can be accepted and exercised in every other
employment involving equal intelligence.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> The domestic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
employee can neither accept nor give an invitation to supper;
she cannot offer a cup of tea to a caller; she does not
ask a friend to remain to dinner, except perhaps at rare
intervals a mother or a sister. She has the privilege of
using without limit for her own necessities the food purchased
by her employer, but she cannot share it without
transgressing this privilege. She cannot invite her
friends for an afternoon tea to meet a friend from another
place, or give a small dinner party or a chafing-dish supper.
She can do none of these things the desire for which
is so natural and which can be gratified in a small way
in almost every other occupation. Even more than this,
she is never a sharer in the general social life of the community.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
She is precluded not by her character but by
her condition from exercising those social privileges which
are instinctive in all persons.</p>

<p>Another social barrier is the failure of society to recognize
the need on the part of the employee of those opportunities
for personal improvement so freely accorded to
those in other occupations. If she has a taste for music
or art she can cultivate it only at the expense of ridicule,<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
while her need of intellectual advantages in a similar way
meets with no recognition.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> If she is refined and cultivated,
she must often associate with those who are coarse
and ignorant.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>But the question of social standing goes farther than
this. Not only are social advantages of every kind
denied the domestic employee, but the badge of social
inferiority is put upon her in characters as unchangeable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
as are the spots of a leopard. This badge assumes several
different forms. The first is the use of the word
“servant.”<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> We may prove from etymology that every
person who confers a favor on another is his servant. We
may present a lawyer’s brief showing to the satisfaction
of every local and national court that every employee in
the eye of the law is a servant. We may argue from the
biblical standpoint and show without a flaw in our chain
of reasoning that we are all servants of one another.
We may point to the classification of occupations made
by the national census bureau and show that clergymen,
doctors, lawyers, teachers, and domestic servants are
placed together. We may quote to every employee the
proudly humble motto of the Prince of Wales, “Ich
dien,” and the example of the Pope, who calls himself
“the servant of the servants of the Lord.” We may by
a social fiction subscribe ourselves a score of times each
day, “Your most humble and obedient servant.” We
may do all of these things, but just as long as common
phraseology restricts the ordinary use of the word to
those persons engaged in domestic employments for
which they receive a fixed compensation, just so long
will arguments prove of no avail and the word “servant”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
continue to be a mark of social degradation. The efforts
of domestic employees to substitute the terms “maid” or
“working housekeeper” have as yet in many quarters
excited little more than ridicule.</p>

<p>A second mark of social inferiority is the use of the
Christian name in address. It may seem a very trifling
matter, yet the fact again remains that domestic employees
are the only class of workers, except day laborers,
who are thus addressed. The weight that is attached to
the matter in other walks of life is seen in the policy of
more than one well-known newspaper; a strong weapon of
attack in encounter with opponents has been the reference
by Christian name to those whom the writers wish to consign
to political obscurity. In no way does advancement
in age and dignity show itself sooner than in the substitution
of the surname for the Christian name. The boy
shows his sense of growing importance by dropping the
Christian name in addressing his companions. In the
eyes of the débutante the first card bearing the name
“Miss Brown” throws into insignificance many other
advantages of the new position. Probably few persons
would choose to go through life addressed by even their
most intimate friends, aside from kith and kin, as are the
class of domestic employees. The use of the Christian
name in address undoubtedly grew out of the close family
relationship that existed between the employer and the
employee, but it has become a badge of social inferiority
since it is used alike by strangers and friends. Any
person considers himself privileged to use the familiar
address towards any employee simply by virtue of the
employee’s position. Even more objectionable is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
English custom, sometimes affected in America, of dropping
the Christian name and using the surname without
a title, since it implies social inferiority even more than
the familiar address.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>A third badge of the position sometimes insisted on is
the cap and apron. These are not worn, as are the cap
and sleeves of the trained nurse, to indicate the completion
of a regular course of scientific training; they are
not the uniform of the postman or the policeman, which
shows the recognition by national or municipal authorities
of superior fitness for the position filled and carries with
it somewhat of the prestige of the power the wearer
serves; they represent necessarily no attainment on the
part of the person wearing them, nor are they, as worn,
always the object of laudable ambition. The cap and
apron sometimes indicate the rise of the employer in the
social scale rather than the professional advance of the
employee. The wider the separation in any community
between employer and employee, the greater is the tendency
to insist on the cap and apron. The same principle
is involved when coachmen are not permitted to wear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
beards and hotel and club waiters are required to sacrifice
the moustache.</p>

<p>A fourth badge is the fact that domestic servants are
made not only to feel but to acknowledge their social
inferiority. Not only deference but even servility of
manner is demanded as of no other class, and this in an
age when social and family relationships are everywhere
becoming more democratic, when reverence and respect for
authority are sometimes considered old-fashioned virtues,
when even undue freedom of speech and manner are permitted
to other classes. The domestic employee receives
and gives no word or look of recognition on the street except
in meeting those of her own class; she is seldom introduced
to the guests of the house, whom she may faithfully
serve during a prolonged visit; the common daily courtesies
exchanged between the members of the household are
not always shown her; she takes no part in the general
conversation around her; she speaks only when addressed,
obeys without murmur orders which her judgment tells
her are absurd, “is not expected to smile under any circumstances,”
and ministers without protest to the whims
and obeys implicitly the commands of children from whom
deference to parents is never expected.</p>

<p>A fifth mark of social inferiority is the fact that
domestic employees, especially those connected with
boarding houses, restaurants, and hotels, are generally
given a fee for every service rendered.</p>

<p>A self-respecting man or woman in any other occupation
is insulted by the offer of a fee. The person
who through mistake offers a fee to a person belonging
to his own station brings upon himself only ridicule<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
and embarrassment. The shop-girl who works for $7 a
week spends half an hour in a vain attempt to match
for a customer a bit of ribbon; but she would be justly
indignant, as would be her employer, if she were offered
a fee. In hotels and restaurants, the larger the establishment
and the more the price of every article should
warrant exemption from such outside dues, the greater
is felt to be the pressure for their payment. Nowhere
else is the democratic principle “first come first served”
so flagrantly violated, and nowhere else would its violation
be tolerated. Feeing is a system of begging that cannot
be reached by charity organization societies, a species
of blackmail levied on all who wish good service, for which
there is no legal redress, a European and American form
of backsheesh that carries with it the taint of the soil
from which it has sprung. It has its origin in snobbishness
and it results in toadyism and flunkeyism. It is objectionable
because it makes the giver feel as humiliated
in giving as the recipient ought to feel in receiving. It
puts a price on that kindness and consideration which
ought to be the “royal bounty” in connection with every
paid service, it destroys genuine sympathy and unselfishness,
it creates an eye service and introduces into every
branch of domestic service an element of demoralization
and degradation that is incalculable. It takes from the
person receiving it the option of placing a value on the
service rendered by him, and it is the only occupation
where fees are given that does not carry with it this
privilege. A lawyer or a physician must be the best
judge of the value of his services, but the domestic servant
takes “what you please.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>

<p>One of the results of the system is indicated by a jesting
paragraph that recently went the rounds of the daily
press to the effect that the porter of the Grand Pacific
Hotel, in Chicago, had retired with a fortune of $100,000
accumulated from tips given him by guests of the house,<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>
while the men who contributed it were still struggling
to keep the wolf from the door. In tipping, as in bribery,
the social odium falls on the one who takes the tip
or the bribe, not on the one who offers it. The fortune
of $100,000, more or less, would not give social position
to one who had acquired it through fees. But the fee
is at bottom a bribe offered for service for which payment
is presumably made by the employer; it is a bribe
because it is an additional sum offered for quick service
or good service which a waiter will not give without this
extra compensation from the person served. As long as
this form of bribery prevails, every person who accepts
the bribe is socially tainted and no amount of financial
success resulting from it can eradicate the taint.</p>

<p>Not only is the fee objectionable in itself, but the
manner of giving it is equally so. It is bestowed surreptitiously,
as if the giver appreciated the fact that he
was doing an insulting thing and was ashamed of it; or
it is offered openly with the patronizing manner of one
who says, “I have no use for such a trifle; take it, if you
wish it.” It is folded in a napkin, tucked under a plate,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
slipped into the hand of a waiter with a vain attempt to
appear unconscious, left ostentatiously on a tray, or contemptuously
flung at an attendant. It can be neither
given nor received with the self-respect that accompanies
any reputable business transaction.</p>

<p>Two excuses for feeing are given. One, “because
every one else does it and one feels contemptible if he
doesn’t do it,” an easy, good-natured way of disposing
of a serious problem. Comparatively few persons are
controlled by general principles; each acts according to
what seems most convenient at the time being. The
second excuse is that employees in hotels and restaurants
and porters in drawing-room and sleeping cars are
underpaid. This is undoubtedly true, and <i>it will remain
true as long as the general public frees the class of hotel,
restaurant, and boarding-house proprietors, and palace and
sleeping car companies, from the responsibility of paying
their own assistants</i>. But the general public also knows
that the saleswomen in many large stores work for almost
nothing, that street-car conductors and motor men are
overworked and underpaid, that school teachers receive
but a pittance. The public, however, pursues here a
different policy; it puts on “the white list” employers
who pay their saleswomen well, it allows street-railway
employees to fight out the matter of low wages by
strikes or in such other ways as they deem fit, it permits
the school teacher to struggle on with a salary
of $400 or $500 a year and patronizes a fair held
for the benefit of a pension fund. It is difficult to see
why this reason for feeing a domestic employee should
not hold good in all underpaid employments; that it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
does not is one reason why those in other occupations
do not fall in the social scale. That the public continues
to pay directly the employees in this occupation as it
does in no other is one explanation of the ill repute
it bears among self-respecting wage-earning men and
women. Every person has a contempt for another who
accepts a fee, and the reproach extends from the individual
to every branch of the occupation he represents.
No other thing has done more to lower domestic
service in the eyes of the public than this most pernicious
custom, and every person who fees a domestic
employee has by that act done something to degrade
what should be an honorable occupation into a menial
service.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>Another phase of the social question is presented by an
employer who writes, “There is something wrong when
a young girl servant is sent out in the evening to accompany
the daughter or perhaps the mistress and return
alone.” If protection is the thought, the maid needs it
as much as the mistress; if it is in deference to a social
custom, the maid must bitterly resent any custom which
demands this distinction between herself and those whom
she serves. Another aspect of the same question is suggested
when it is realized what veritable dens of iniquity
are some of the intelligence offices in large cities, and
how difficult it often is for a domestic employee to come
in contact with them without becoming contaminated by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
the touch. These are the things that lead many to
believe that “the kitchen has become very like a social
Botany Bay.”<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<p>It is this social position with its accompanying marks
of social inferiority that, more than any other one thing,
turns the scale against domestic service as an occupation
in the thoughts of many intelligent and ambitious women
whose tastes naturally incline them to domestic employments.
Professor Arthur T. Hadley has well said in a
discussion of comparative wages, “One thing which counts
for more and costs more than anything else is social
standing.”<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> The social standing maintained by a cash
girl on $3 a week which she fears to lose by going into
domestic service ought not to be vastly superior to what is
within the reach of intelligent cooks earning $10 a week;
yet undoubtedly it is; and while this is true the number
of intelligent women in domestic service will not increase.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>

<p>Other objections to domestic service in addition to
those enumerated are sometimes made. Some of them
arise from misconceptions,<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> others are trivial and do not
demand consideration, while others are individual rather
than general. These are the disadvantages that tell
most strongly against the occupation. They do not include
the element of ill-treatment by mistresses or their
lack of consideration; or the fact that there is sometimes
much in the tone and manner of an employer that is most
irritating to a self-respecting person; or that there are
occasionally employers who feel that they rise in the social
scale in the same proportion that they make employees
sensible of inferiority or dependence; or that many mistresses
demand more than can be performed; or that
some employers are unreasonable, others disagreeable,
and still others petulant and fault-finding; or that some
“expect perfection at twelve dollars a month and positive
genius at thirteen.” These conditions are found,
but they are not peculiar to domestic service; the disadvantages
discussed are all independent of good or bad
personal treatment, they may be modified by the character
of the family to whom the service is rendered, but
they cannot be removed by any individual employer
acting alone, however much he has at heart the interests
of his own employee or of domestic employees as a class.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<p>In comparing the advantages and disadvantages of
domestic service as an occupation it will be obvious that
the advantages are numerous, substantial, and easily recognized;
the disadvantages are many, but they are far
more subtile, intangible, and far reaching. The advantages
are those which the economic woman always sees
and which take her from unhealthy tenement houses into
country air and sunshine; from overcrowded occupations
into one where the demand for workers is and always
must be unlimited; from starvation wages to peace and
plenty; from long hours of dreary mechanical toil to intelligent
work; from failure in an uncongenial occupation
to success and prosperity in this; from a life whose sufferings
and privations, as yet but half told, have roused the
sympathies of all social reformers, to a life of freedom
from the sweater, the floor-walker, the officious and vulgar
superintendent, the industrial Shylocks of every occupation,
to a life of comparative ease and comfort. But
while the economic woman, like the economic man, always
sees these things, the actual woman looks at another side.
She does not understand why work that society calls the
most honorable a woman can do when done in her own home
without remuneration, becomes demeaning when done in
the house of another for a fixed compensation, but she recognizes
the fact; she sees that discredit comes not from the
work itself but from the conditions under which it is performed,
and she does not willingly place herself in these conditions;
she sees that a class line is always drawn as in no
other occupation; she is willing and glad to pay her life
for what seems to her <i>life</i>—excitement, city ways, society
of home friends, personal independence which another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
might call slavery. She does not care for those advantages
which another person points out; to her they
count as nothing in comparison with the price she must
pay for them. Of five hundred and forty employees of
whom the question was asked, “Would you give up
housework if you could find another occupation that
would pay you as well?” one-half answered, “Yes.”
Yet the number is very small of those who complain of
ill-treatment or lack of consideration on the part of the
employer. There is, indeed, often much ground for complaint
on this score, but it must be seen that other relationships
besides the personal ones are entered into when
the relation of employer and employee is established.
That which decides the question is not always the economic
advantage, not always the personal treatment, but
that subtile thing the woman calls <i>life</i>. “Wages, hours,
health, and morals” may all weigh in the scale in favor
of domestic service, but <i>life</i> outweighs them all. The
advantages are such as lead many people to urge domestic
service for the daughters of others, the disadvantages
are such as incline them to choose any occupation but this
for their own daughters.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<span class="smaller">DOUBTFUL REMEDIES</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The difficulties attending domestic service are so many
and so pressing that a large number of measures intended
to meet them have been proposed, all of them as varied
as the personalities of those dealing with the problem.
This difference of opinion in regard to the best methods
of meeting the question is largely due to the fact that,
not domestic service as an occupation, but domestic servants
as individuals have been considered. It has also
come from the fact that while the feudal castle of the
Middle Ages has shrunk to the city apartment, the attempt
is made to preserve intact the customs that had
their origin in mediævalism and ought to have died with
it, overlooking the fact that every other occupation has
made at least some slight concession to economic progress.
Moreover, it must be said that the purely ethical phases
of the subject have been the ones most often kept in
mind in discussing measures of relief. This ethical side
of the question is indeed important, but it is largely
based on the assumption that the relation between employer
and employee is a purely personal one. Since the
discussion of the question up to this point has been
based on a different theory, namely, that other relations
besides the personal ones are established when that of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
employer and employee is assumed, and that domestic
service has been and is affected by political, economic,
industrial, social, and educational questions, the present
discussion of possible and impossible remedies in domestic
service cannot take into consideration the purely ethical
questions involved in the subject, but must deal with its
other aspects.</p>

<p>Before attempting to answer the question of what can
and what cannot be done, a few general principles deduced
from the consideration of the subject up to this
point must be indicated. First, since the evils are many
and complicated no panacea can be found. The patent
medicine that cures every physical ailment from consumption
to chilblains is disappearing before the scientific
studies of the day; it is quite as little to be recommended
for economic and social maladies. Second, the remedy
applied must have some relation to the nature of the disease.
A sprained wrist will not yield to the treatment
for dyspepsia, nor can rheumatism and deafness be cured
by the same brown pills. The principle does not differ
if moral remedies are administered for educational diseases
and economic maladies are expected to succumb to
social tonics. Third, reform in domestic service must be
accomplished along the same general economic lines as
are reforms in other great departments of labor—not at
right angles to general industrial progress. Fourth, reform
in domestic service must be the result of evolution
from present conditions and tendencies—not a special
creation. Fifth, no reform can be instituted which will
remove to-morrow all difficulties that exist to-day. Domestic
service cannot reach at a bound the goal towards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
which other forms of labor have been moving with halting
steps.</p>

<p>These principles are simple and will perhaps be generally
accepted. A few of the measures often suggested as
affording means of relief may be tested by them.</p>

<p>It is the opinion of a very large class that all difficulties
can be removed by the application of the golden rule.
No belief is more widespread than this. But it rests
wholly on the assumption that the relation between employer
and employee is a personal one, and presupposes
that if this personal relationship could be made an ideal
one the question would settle itself. In so far as the
connection between mistress and maid is a personal one,
the golden rule is sufficient, but other factors are involved
in the problem. The golden rule may be ever so
perfectly observed, but that fact does not eliminate the
competition of other industries where the golden rule
may be observed with equal conscientiousness, nor does
it remove the distasteful competition of American born
employees with foreigners and negroes; it does not overcome
the preference for city life or the love of personal
independence; it is not always able to substitute intelligence,
capability, interest, and economy for ignorance,
inefficiency, indifference, and waste; the observance of
the golden rule by the employer is not a guarantee that
it will always be followed by the employee. For moral
difficulties, moral remedies must be applied, but they will
not always operate where the maladies are in their nature
economic, social, and educational. The golden rule is a
poultice that will relieve an inflammation but will not
remove the cause of the evil—a tonic that will invigorate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
the system but which cannot be substituted for surgical
treatment.</p>

<p>Another class of persons believes that the application of
intelligence as well as of ethical principles is what is required
of the employer. This position is best expressed by
the correspondent of a leading journal who says: “The
capable housekeeper is quite satisfied with the performance
of her own domestic duties. If a true woman performs her
whole duty, that which lies within her sphere of action,
this everlasting cry of reform in domestic service would
cease and in its place there would rise a more satisfied
race of human beings.” But intelligence, capability, and
the observance of all ethical principles must, like the
golden rule, encounter the question of free Sundays and
evenings after six o’clock, as well as that of the regularity
of working hours and the possibility of promotion found
in other occupations. No system ever has been or ever
can be found that will enable a housekeeper to conduct a
household satisfactorily on the instinct or the inspiration
theory, to substitute sentiment for educated intelligence
and for a knowledge of economic conditions outside of the
individual home. The ostrich is said to cover its head
in the sand and imagine that it is safe from capture; as
well may the individual employer say, “I have settled
the question for myself; it is sufficient and I am
satisfied.”</p>

<p>A third suggestion in harmony with the two preceding
is to receive the employee into the family of the employer,
giving her all of the family privileges, including a seat at
the table. This plan finds many advocates among intelligent,
conscientious employers who are earnestly trying to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
find a way out of present troubles. But there are several
objections to it. One is the fact that such a policy is
a distinct deviation from all economic tendencies of the
century. A hundred years ago under the domestic system
of manufactures the masterworkman received his
apprentices into his family, and no other arrangement
seemed possible. The factory system has revolutionized
this manner of life, and a return to it in manufacturing
industries would be as impossible as a restoration of the
feudal system itself. The attempt to return to what was
once a common custom in many parts of the North is an
attempt to restore the patriarchal relationship between
employer and employee in a generation which looks with
disfavor on paternalism in other forms of labor. Another
objection to the plan is its inherent impossibility. John
Stuart Mill could conceive of another world where two
and two do not make four, but it must in this world be at
present an impossibility to conceive of a family in which
the idea of unity is not an essential feature. The very
foundation of a family is its integrity. Four plus one
half can never equal five, and no one can ever be more
than a fraction in any family into which he has not been
born, married, or legally adopted. The family circle cannot
be squared, and if it could be, the curve of beauty
would be lost. Moreover, even if the plan could be
carried out, it would not meet the needs of the majority
of employees or of those who would become such if the
conditions of service were more favorable. <i>What domestics
as a class desire is the opportunity of living their own
lives in their own way.</i> This is what other occupations
offer to a greater degree than does domestic service, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
it is one reason for the preference for them. The desire
is not always on the part of the employees for the same
friends, the same amusements, the same privileges, the
same opportunities, the same interests, as those of their
employers, but it is to have such friends, such amusements,
such privileges, such opportunities, such interests,
as they personally crave. Even what would be in themselves
the greatest advantages often cease to be such
when the element of personal choice in regard to them is
removed. Still another objection is the failure of the
plan to subserve the best interests of the employer, even
granting that it is best for the employee. It grows out
of the nature of the family, as previously suggested.
Comparatively few persons are willing, except as a business
necessity, to open their homes even temporarily to
those compelled to board. The privacy of home life is
destroyed to even a greater extent by the attempt to
make household employees permanently a part of it, not
because those admitted within the family circle are of
this particular class, but because they are not of the
family. Marriage has been called a process of naturalization—a
difficult one when all the conditions are most
favorable. The process is infinitely more difficult when
an extraneous element is introduced into a family, not
as a result of mutual choice, but of a business agreement.</p>

<p>A fourth proposition for lessening the difficulties in
domestic service is to increase the number of employees
by bringing to the North negroes from the South. So
seriously has this plan been contemplated that companies
have in some places already been formed, and through
them colored servants have been sent to different parts of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
the Eastern states. But this plan assumes that no perplexities
exist where colored servants are found, and also
that there are no difficulties which a greater supply of
domestic employees will not remove. That the former
assumption cannot rightly be made is evident from many
facts. The anomalous condition is found in at least one
Southern city of an organization to assist Northern housekeepers
to secure colored servants, and of another to aid
Southern housekeepers in obtaining white employees from
the North.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> The examination of a large number of advertisements
for “help wanted” shows apparently a preference
in many parts of the South for white servants,<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
while the testimony of many employers seems to show
that service is at present in a transitional state—the older
generation is disappearing, while in the younger generation
the same tendencies are found as in other classes of
employees.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> The second assumption, that the question
is settled wherever the supply is greater than the demand,
also seems unwarranted in the judgment of many.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> These<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
facts are in no sense to be regarded as an exhaustive
presentation of the condition of domestic service at the
South; they only indicate that in the opinion of many
intelligent employers “the question of negro help is as
broad as the negro question itself.” If it has proved
such to those who know the negro best, there is little
hope that Northern employers would gain more than new
and perplexing complications by introducing as domestic
servants large numbers of negroes from the South.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span></p>

<p>Another suggestion of the same character is the importation
of Chinese servants. While much has been
said of the superiority of the Chinese as household employees,<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>
and not a few housekeepers would be glad to
see the restriction act repealed,<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> difficulties other than
the present legislative and political ones stand in the way
of adopting this policy. The Chinese, as well as the
negroes, occupy in this country a social position inferior
to that of Americans or Europeans. Gresham’s law may
perhaps be applied to domestic service and the principle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
stated that superior and inferior labor cannot exist side
by side—the inferior must drive out the superior. Unless
employees of the lower social grade can be imported
in such numbers as to meet every call for domestic servants,
there must exist, as now, the discrepancy between
supply and demand. The old struggle between free
labor and slave labor must be repeated in miniature
wherever the social chasm exists between two classes of
laborers. The introduction to any considerable extent
of Chinese servants would drive out European labor as
that has in a measure driven out native born American
service.</p>

<p>As a means of promoting a better adjustment of the
business relations between employer and employee, it is
sometimes proposed that licenses should be granted domestic
employees by municipal corporations. This plan,
however, would be a violation of the principles underlying
the granting of such licenses. A municipal body is
not justified in granting a license to any employment or
industry unless such occupation is objectionable in itself
as entailing expense, or danger of expense on the part of
the taxpayers, as the sale of intoxicating liquors; or unless
it involves special use by non-taxpayers of city improvements
made at the expense of the taxpayers, as in
the case of cabmen; or unless it brings into competition
with tax-paying industries trades which contribute nothing
to the general treasury, as is true of travelling peddlers;
or unless it brings special danger, as of fire in
the case of theatrical companies. The license is a tax
imposed in return for special risks incurred or privileges
granted. Domestic service comes under none of these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
principles, and to place it under the care of municipal
authorities as is not done with other occupations of its
class would be to degrade it in an unjustifiable way.
The license, when granted in accordance with a principle,
is not more objectionable than an ordinary tax; if granted
without principle, it becomes an obnoxious and tyrannical
measure.</p>

<p>The system of German service books has been widely
advocated as an efficient means of securing reliable testimony
as to the character and capabilities of employees,
thus removing one of the most serious of present difficulties.
But even in Germany, where obedience is man’s
first law, as order is heaven’s first law in other parts of
the world, it is impossible to obtain service books that do
not need to be supplemented by personal inquiries. The
service book is of value in weeding out the most inefficient
employees, but it can do little more. As in any
other form of recommendation, the employer wishes to
say the best possible thing for a servant that he may not
injure his prospects of obtaining another place. Moreover,
the law compels every employer to believe an employee
innocent until he is proved guilty. The employer
must state that the servant is honest unless he has proof
positive to the contrary. He is not permitted to say that
he is suspicious, or even to leave out the word “honest.”
The policy is a necessary protection to the weaker class,
but it must vitiate somewhat the absolute reliability of
the testimonials given. The German service book has a
place where all occupations are permeated by government
control, but it cannot be introduced into America. We
must work out our own system of improvement in household<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
service as we have worked out our own political
system.</p>

<p>Other measures have been suggested that call for only
a passing notice. It is often proposed to call together a
convention of housekeepers to discuss the subject. But
the mass must be disintegrated before anything can be
accomplished, and moreover the difficulty of calling together
such a convention and of securing through it any
permanent results is the same as is found in political
circles in attempting to organize a citizens’ party.</p>

<p>Other housekeepers seriously advocate abolishing the
public schools above the primary grade on the ground that
girls are educated above their station, and they follow the
plan of one who says, “I do not engage women who have
been beyond the third reader and the multiplication
table.” The quality of service obtained by such a policy
is indicated by the remark of the father of a remarkably
stupid girl, “She ain’t good for much; I guess she’ll have
to live out.” No statement can be more fallacious than
that girls are educated above their station. There can
be no so-called “station” in a democratic country. We
have given the reins to our democratic views politically,
and we must abide by the industrial and social results.</p>

<p>Still other housekeepers advocate the introduction of
housework into all the public schools, and thus securing
well-informed “help.” But both this proposition and its
converse overlook the fact that it is the function of the
public school <i>to educate</i>, not to supply information on
technical subjects.</p>

<p>In one large city a “Servant Reform Association” has
been organized, with an office on a prominent street-corner,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
and its name conspicuously posted over the door and
painted on all the window shades. Its clientele is very
large and embraces some of the best-known residents of
the city. Among other measures of reforming servants
it plans for the establishment of schools to be equipped
with every household appliance, and “to have for instructors
women who are thoroughly schooled in the various
branches of household duties and domestic economy,”
but it does not state where such instructors are to be
obtained. Nothing shows so clearly how the times are
out of joint as does the name of such an association.</p>

<p>The plan most widely advocated and believed to contain
the greatest possibilities for improvement in domestic
service, is that of establishing training-schools for
servants, such schools to have a regular course of study
and to grant a diploma on the satisfactory completion of
the work. Much can be said in favor of the theory of
such schools. If universally established, they would
greatly lessen the ignorance and inexperience of the
employees—one of the greatest stumbling-blocks in the
way of improvement in the service. The diploma would
be in effect a license without the objectionable features
of the latter, and it would be a testimonial of capability
and moral character more reliable than the personal recommendation
of previous unknown employers. It would
render possible a better gradation of wages, a more perfect
organization of domestic work, and more satisfactory
business relations between employer and employee. In
no occupation is there greater need for systematic training.
The army of incompetents in domestic service is
not greater than in other occupations, but incompetency<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
here is far more productive than elsewhere of inconvenience
and positive suffering. Without such public and
regular training every housekeeper is compelled to make
a training-school of her own house, and too often she
herself lacks the necessary information she ought to impart.
But two test questions must be applied to the
theory. First, as far as it has been carried out, has it
accomplished what was expected of it? Second, is the
training-school for servants in harmony with the educational,
industrial, and social tendencies of the day?</p>

<p>The demand for such training-schools has been almost
universal, and reports of their immediate establishment
on a large scale have been repeatedly circulated through
the press. One of the most widely spread rumors concerned
a movement to be set on foot in connection with
the World’s Fair in 1893 for the organization of a national
body with branches throughout every state and
county in the country, each of these branches to establish
a training-school for servants wherever practicable, and
another concerned a scarcely less extended work to be
begun in Washington. As far as can be learned, however,
the number of such schools actually established has
been extremely limited, and most of these have been discontinued
for lack of success. As far as the results have
been concerned, it must be said that, while not a failure,
they have been far from commensurate with the efforts
expended. In one training-school with accommodations
for twenty, where neither labor nor expense had been
spared to make it a success, there were when visited but
five persons in attendance, and these five were the most
unpromising material that could be brought together to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
train for such service, one being a partial cripple, another
very deaf, a third too young to take the responsibility
of a general servant, a fourth was deficient in mental
capacity, and the fifth was a Swedish girl who attended
to learn English. Another school also having accommodations
for twenty reported that the number had never
been full. The most successful of them all had had, a
year or two since, total attendance of about four hundred
during its ten years’ existence.</p>

<p>The practical difficulties in the way of all these schools
have been many. The minimum age of admission has
been fixed at sixteen, but there has been constant pressure
to make exceptions to the rule and take girls under
that age. The course has been usually one of three
months, but this time is insufficient for the thorough
training of immature girls in household duties; yet to
extend the course is to decrease the attendance. Those
who enter such schools do so, not because those who have
attended them have been unusually successful in securing
work and retaining good positions, but because sent there
by friends, guardians, pastors, or city missionaries. In
no instance, so far as known, has a person entered a training-school
because she found herself incompetent to fill
the position she had taken, or from a desire to perfect
herself in any branch of her work. Much has been
accomplished through these schools for the individuals
attending them; personal habits have been improved,
better motives in life given,—everything that has been
most admirable in a philanthropic way. But it must
be said that they have done little or nothing towards
accomplishing the object for which they were established;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
the effect in elevating domestic service, in increasing the
supply of trained servants, in lessening the prevailing
ignorance of household affairs, has been infinitesimal. <i>The
training-school for servants is and must be a failure as long
as the class for whom it was founded will not voluntarily
attend it in any considerable numbers for the sake of the
instruction it is primarily intended to give.</i> They will
not attend it because while there is a theoretical demand
for such schools on the part of employers there is no
practical demand for them. Young women will not
spend three months in learning the details of such work
when they can receive high wages for doing it without
such instruction; not until domestic service loses its distinctive
marks of drudgery, menial servitude, and social
degradation will the training-school receive any large
accession to its numbers. Moreover, public opinion has
not yet demanded that every housekeeper should have
both a general and a technical knowledge of domestic
affairs before she assumes the care of a household. The
stream cannot rise higher than its source, and the training-school
for employees cannot succeed so long as
employers are content with unscientific methods in their
own share of the household duties. It is often said that
by the establishment of training-schools for nurses what
was formerly a trade, held in little repute, has become a
profession second only in importance to that of the physician,
and that in a similar way the training-school for
domestic servants would elevate domestic service. But
a vital difference exists in the two cases. Until scarcely
more than a generation ago the medical profession could
lay little or no claim to being an exact science. Most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
medical schools were poorly equipped and had a short
course of study, while all their processes were largely
experimental. But the Civil War and the scientific
studies resulting from it have made of surgery an exact
science, while rapid strides in biological investigation
have gone far towards making other branches of medicine
also exact sciences. It has been well said that “educational
forces pull from the top, they do not push from
the bottom.” It has been the educational forces pulling
from the top as a result of increased scientific knowledge
among the leaders of the medical profession that have
made the training-school for nurses a necessity. Not until
similar forces pull from the top in the household through
the scientific and economic investigation of the processes
carried on there, will a permanent, successful training-school
for employees be even a remote possibility.</p>

<p>It must be said also that the training-school for domestic
servants must be a failure as long as it is out of harmony
with the tendencies in all other fields of education
and industry. Technical schools are everywhere springing
up, and the demand for them is constantly increasing.
But the technical school teaches general and fundamental
principles, the wood carver learns drawing, the plumber
chemistry, the architect mathematics, and the engineer
mechanics. In each trade or profession the first step is
the principle underlying it, and the second the practical
application of the principle. In the training-school for
servants with a three months’ course, the educational idea
is and must be totally different. Those attending it are
taken without examination, often they have had no previous
education whatever, they may be of varying grades of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
intelligence and capability, and any attempt at classification
according to these grades is impossible. Its members
must learn how to cook without a knowledge of
chemistry and physiology, to care for a room without
knowing the principles of ventilation and sanitation, and
to arrange a table in ignorance of form and color. The
work must be learned by simple mechanical repetition—a
method fast disappearing from every department of
education.</p>

<p>Again, such a plan is in opposition to present political
and social tendencies. A training-school for servants is
an anomaly in a democratic country. No father or
mother born under the Declaration of Independence will
ever send a child to be trained as a servant. A striking
illustration of this is found in recent accounts of a new
building about to be erected in a large city for the use of
a woman’s organization. Those in charge of the organization
established a few years since a kitchen garden for
the children of the poor. Families recommended by the
Charity Organization Society were visited and the attendance
of the young daughters of the family solicited. “At
first not a few mothers objected on the ground that they
did not wish to have their daughters trained to be servants,
even if they were poor, but when it was explained
that the object of the kitchen garden was to make the
children more tidy and useful in their own homes the
objection usually disappeared.” Yet in the face of this
experience—a common one wherever kitchen gardens
have been started—the managers of the organization
have provided for the establishment of a training-school
for servants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>The opposition to such schools on social grounds is not
strange. No recognized industrial aristocracy is possible
in America. There are no training-schools for masons,
carpenters, day-laborers, or clerks. In the technical
school the boy learns masonry, carpentry, and brick-laying,
but in these schools there is no division of those attending
into “classes for gentlemen” and “classes for
laborers.” American men will never recognize one kind
of training for a superior social class, and another for an
inferior. The training-school for servants means the
introduction of a caste system utterly at variance with
democratic ideas. It has not been possible at any time
since the abolition of slavery to educate any class in
society to be servants; it will never again be possible in
America. Democracy among men and aristocracy among
women cannot exist side by side; friction is as inevitable
as it was between free labor and slave labor in the
ante-bellum days. Opportunity for scientific training in
all household employments must ultimately be given in
such a form that any and all persons can obtain it, but it
can never be given in a school distinctively intended for
the training of servants and called by that name.</p>

<p>Another plan, perhaps less widely but even more earnestly
advocated by its supporters, is that of co-operative
housekeeping. There has been much looseness of phraseology
in referring to this plan, and many experiments
have been called co-operative housekeeping which are
such in no sense of the word. Co-operative housekeeping,
pure and simple, as described by the pioneer in the
movement, Mrs. Melusina Fay Peirce,<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> means the association<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
in a stock company of not fewer than twelve or
fifteen families. The first step is the opening of a co-operative
grocery on the plan adopted by the Rochdale
Pioneers, and this to be followed by the opening of a
bakery, and later by a kitchen for cooking soups, meats,
and vegetables. The next department to be organized is
that of sewing, beginning with the establishment of a
small dry-goods store, and developing from this the making
of underclothes, dresses, cloaks, and bonnets. The
last step is to organize a co-operative laundry. The
main industries pursued in every house—cooking, sewing,
and laundering—are thus to be taken out of the house
and carried on at a central point, while the profits on all
the retail purchases are ultimately to accrue to the
purchasers.</p>

<p>The advantages in the scheme are in the saving of
expense in buying, economy in the preparation of all the
materials consumed, a division of labor on the part of the
co-operators which enables each to follow her own tastes
in work, and a removal of all difficulties with the subject
of service by making the servants responsible to a corporation,
not to individuals. The essential point in the
whole plan, and that which justifies the name, is that each
housekeeper is to take an active part not only in the
management, but also in the actual work of the association,
since co-operation ceases to be such if one individual
or “manager” is paid for assuming the responsibility of
the business.</p>

<p>The Cambridge, Massachusetts, Co-operative Housekeeping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
Association was organized in 1870 with forty
shareholders and continued about one year. It approached
more nearly than any other experiment that
has been made to the ideal of its chief promoter, Mrs.
Peirce, but failed in the opinion of its founder for three
reasons: because all the shareholders did not patronize
the co-operative store; because three departments of
work—a bakery, kitchen, and laundry—were begun at
the same time instead of being allowed to develop as
experience should dictate; and because the whole was
given over to the charge of a board of seven directors,
one of whom was to be a paid officer and the manager
of the entire business. The theory in its realization,
therefore, lacked some of the essentials of a true co-operative
enterprise, but even in this form it is believed
to have been the only experiment that can in
any real sense of the word be called co-operative
housekeeping.</p>

<p>The plan of co-operative housekeeping would, if carried
out successfully, undoubtedly remove many of the
difficulties of the question of service. But it presents
others, some of which are inherent in human nature
and therefore not easily or speedily removed. It presupposes
that all persons are equally endowed by nature
with business instinct, which by cultivation will develop
into business success; it overlooks the fact that ninety-five
per cent of men do not succeed in business when conducting
it independently, and that these are in the employ of
the few gifted with executive talent, “one of the rarest
of human endowments.” Again, the same difficulty
exists as was presented to Louis XVIII. when he attempted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
to create a new order of nobility after the restoration
of the Bourbon line; history tells us that he
could find many willing to be dukes and earls but none
willing to be anything less. Most persons are willing
to co-operate in the management of an association, but
modern industry, Nicholas Payne Gilman has well said,
“takes on more and more the character of a civilized
warfare in which regiments of brigadier-generals are
quite out of place.”</p>

<p>Co-operation also requires for its success certain
positive characteristics. It implies an ability to subordinate
the individual to the general welfare, to sacrifice
present comfort to future good, to decide whether
an act is right or wrong by making it general, to put
all questions on an impersonal basis. The principles on
which the family is organized and the conditions surrounding
the housekeeper make these necessary qualifications
peculiarly hard to attain. Ideal co-operative
housekeeping implies ideal co-operators, and these it
will be difficult to find before the majority of the employers
have more business training and more unselfishness
than are now found.</p>

<p>All the arguments that prevail against co-operation
in ordinary business enterprises must prevail against
the system in household management. “All that is
needed is the proper person to take the charge,” it is
often explained. But it is at this very point that the
theory breaks down. If the competent manager is secured,
the plan ceases to be co-operative housekeeping.
But the competent manager is the most difficult person
in the world to find. “The man we want to manage our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
farm has a farm of his own,” said a city lawyer of the old
family homestead; the same principle holds in the household.
It must be said too that neither productive nor
distributive co-operation has yet proved an unqualified
success in other industries where the difficulties to be
encountered are far less than in the case of that most
complicated of organisms—the modern household. A
larger number of successful experiments in co-operation
must have been tried in this country in other and simpler
fields before co-operative housekeeping can prove a panacea
for all the troubles attending domestic service.</p>

<p>Certain practical difficulties have also been found. In
all experiments in pure or partial co-operative housekeeping
it has been found impossible to deliver cooked food
hot and invariable in quality at the same hour to all the
members of the association. In one city a company was
organized as a business enterprise to furnish hot lunches
to business men at their offices and also to supply family
tables. The prices charged were double those of ordinary
table-board, but the expenses were very heavy, no
dividends were ever declared, and the object was ultimately
changed to that of supplying clubs and private
entertainments. That clock-like regularity in the serving
of meals, demanded alike by health and business hours,
is impossible, unless co-operation is universal, where families
in the association reside from five to twenty blocks
apart.</p>

<p>But the most insuperable objection to co-operative
housekeeping as a remedy for the troubles with servants
is the fact that the majority of persons do not wish it.
The proposition suggests to many the homely adage of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
curing the disease by killing the patient. When its
friends say in its favor, “Every time an apartment house
is built having one common dining-room and one kitchen
a blow is aimed at the isolated home,” the great majority
of Americans rise up in protest. The semi-co-operative
system of living is apparently rendered necessary in New
York City by reason of the enormous value of land,
but wherever the detached house having light on four
sides is possible, as it is everywhere else, the American
home-lover will rally to its support. Unless the desire
for co-operative housekeeping and co-operative living becomes
more general than it is at present, some other means
of relief must be sought.</p>

<p>Much, however, of the so-called co-operative housekeeping
is in reality co-operative boarding. This is true
of “The Roby” experiment tried successfully for a time
at Decatur, Illinois.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> Fifty-four of the leading persons
in the city formed a club, adopted a constitution and bylaws,
elected officers, and found that through this organization
they could “live off the fat of the land for $2.75
per week.” The plan in its essence is an old one; it has
been followed for years by college students in institutions
that do not provide dormitories. In many college towns
it is rendered almost necessary by virtue of the residence
there of many persons owning houses who wish to take
lodgers but not boarders and of many women without
capital who wish to act as housekeepers. But probably
few college students consider it an ideal way of living, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
is tolerable only at a time of life when new experiences
are always welcome, and few have ever been known to
continue it beyond college days.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly by a system of co-operative boarding many
families could live better, at much less expense, and at a
saving of time and certain kinds of friction. But co-operative
boarding is to the employer what high wages
are to the employee—he is willing to sacrifice something
for what seems to him <i>life</i>, that is, in this case, the unity,
privacy, quiet, and independence of family life. The
friction with servants is obviated since the plan includes
a housekeeper who is to stand between the co-operators
and the employees, but the common interest of desiring
freedom from the care of servants and of securing the
best board at the lowest rates is not a tie strong enough
to bind together those whose interests in other directions
are most diverse. Co-operative boarding will do much
for the vast army of persons obliged to board, but all
such plans should receive their proper designation and
not be called co-operative housekeeping. For the great
majority of housekeepers who do not care to give up
their individual homes, the system proposed will bring no
relief.</p>

<p>Still a third scheme called co-operative housekeeping is
that proposed by Mr. Bellamy.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> This is a union of co-operative
housekeeping and co-operative boarding, with
the application to both of certain business principles already
recognized in the housekeeping of to-day. In so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
far as it is a combination of the two plans already discussed,
it is open to the same criticisms as are its component
parts, while the business principles suggested are the
result of the same unconscious, not conscious, co-operation
that governs all industries.</p>

<p>It must be said, therefore, that all of these various
measures of relief proposed to meet the difficulty fail,
because, like the golden rule and the admission of the
employee into the family life of the employer, they do not
touch the economic, educational, and industrial difficulties;
or because, like the license, the importation of negro and
Chinese labor, the training-school for servants and co-operative
housekeeping, they run at right angles to general
economic, educational, and industrial progress. The
question how to improve the present condition of domestic
service is, however, not a hopeless one, but the answer to
it must be based on an examination of the historical and
economic principles underlying the subject.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br>
<span class="smaller">POSSIBLE REMEDIES—GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span></h2>

</div>

<p>It has been seen that any measure looking towards a
lessening of the difficulties that stand in the way of
securing at all times and in all places competent domestic
employees, must fail of its object if it does not take
into consideration economic history, economic conditions,
and economic tendencies. Economic history has shown
the remarkable effect of inventive genius and business
activity on all household employments, and through them
on domestic service; a study of economic conditions has
shown the nature of the perplexities surrounding both
employer and employee. What are the social and economic
tendencies in accordance with which relief from
present difficulties must be sought?</p>

<p>The first industrial tendency to be noted is that toward
the concentration of capital and labor in large industrial
enterprises. Not only have the factory and the mill
superseded the individual system of manufactures, but
the growth of “bonanza farms” and the increasing number
of tenant farms show the same tendency in agriculture;
the trust is the resort of wholesale business houses;
the department stores of the day are driving out of the
retail business circles the smaller houses of a generation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
ago; the pool may be considered an illustration of the
same tendency at work in transportation industries.</p>

<p>A second tendency, forming the converse of the preceding
one, is towards specialization in every department
of labor. Adam Smith’s famous illustration of this principle—that
he found ten persons able to make nearly five
thousand pins in a day, while each person working alone
could make but one pin—can be seen in every department
of work except in the household. Everywhere the
field of labor has been narrowed in order to secure the
largest and best results.</p>

<p>A third tendency, growing out of these two, is towards
the association and combination for mutual benefit of
persons interested in special lines of work. Nearly every
class of employers has its own special organization; the
associated press, associated charities, local, state, and national
educational associations, and associations of learned
societies, show the influence of organization in other departments;
nearly every class of employees also has its
trade union or mutual benefit association; everywhere,
except in the household, mutual interests are drawing
together for protection, for consultation, for economy of
forces and resources, for a score of reasons, those engaged
in the same activities.</p>

<p>A fourth tendency is the result of the specialization
of labor in its higher forms. As all industries become
more highly organized, greater preparation for work is
required wherever labor ceases to be purely mechanical.
Trade schools, technical schools, and schools for training
in special work are everywhere demanded, and the
demand must in time be fully met. While specialization<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
is the end, special training must be the means to
accomplish it.</p>

<p>A fifth tendency is towards a realization of the fact
that all who share in industrial processes should participate
in the benefits resulting from their work, that “perpendicular”
rather than “horizontal divisions” in labor
should be the aim in all industry. This is seen in the
various efforts made to introduce productive and distributive
co-operation, profit sharing, and other measures
intended to give employees a share in the results of their
labors, and thus to take a personal interest in their work.</p>

<p>A sixth tendency is towards greater industrial independence
on the part of women. This is an inevitable
result of the substitution of the factory for the domestic
system of manufactures, and of the entrance of women
into all industrial pursuits at the time of the Civil War,
as well as of the inherent demand in every person for
some opportunity for honorable work. A comparison of
the different census reports shows that the percentage
of women engaged in remunerative occupations increases
faster than the percentage of men so engaged. Massachusetts
shows a larger percentage than any other state
of women occupied in business industry, while the investigations
of the Massachusetts Bureau of Statistics of
Labor show that the marriage rate and the birth rate in
that state are both increasing. The facts and conditions
do not seem to show that the tendency is incompatible
with home life.</p>

<p>One other semi-social and industrial tendency must be
noted. It is the result of that systematic study of social
conditions seen in the evolution of the principles that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
best way to help a person is to help him to help himself,
and that reasonable measures aim at the amelioration of
some of the conditions under which work is performed,
not at the cessation of the work itself. The application
of these principles has led to wiser charities, to the Chautauqua
movement, to university extension, to working-girls’
clubs, to enlarged opportunities everywhere for
every class. These movements springing up in every
locality mean that every individual is to have the opportunity
of making the most of himself possible, and that
the responsibility of so doing is to rest with him, not
with society; they mean that ultimately the position in
society of every person is to depend not on his occupation,
but on the use he has made of these increasing
opportunities for self-help and self-improvement; they
mean that in time all social stigma will be removed from
every occupation and work judged by its quality rather
than by its nature; that in time, for example, a first-class
cook will receive more honor than a second-class china
decorator, or a third-rate teacher.</p>

<p>One general tendency in all business circles must also
be mentioned—that towards increasing publicity in all
business matters. It is coming to be recognized that
society has the right to know certain general and even
specific facts in regard to the conduct of affairs formerly
guarded in jealous privacy by the individual. The
National Census Bureau requires, for the benefit of
society, an answer to a large number of personal questions,
and the requirement is resisted only by the most
ignorant. The state bureaus of labor have legal authority
to obtain information in regard to the management of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
business enterprises which they wish to investigate. The
salaries of all public employees are officially published, and
legal inquiry is instituted when the expenses of such
employees largely exceed the salary received. The number
of joint-stock companies is increasing, and these companies
are legally bound to render full and exact accounts
of all receipts and expenditures. The Chinese wall of
absolute privacy is practically retained only with reference
to household occupations.</p>

<p>If then the question in domestic service is this: How
can the supply of domestic servants be increased, or how
can the demand for them be lessened? the only answer
must be, by bringing household employments and
household service into the current of these and other
industrial and social tendencies. To state the case in
detail, the problem is not so much how to improve the
personal relationship between the employer and the employee
as it is to decrease this relationship; not how to
increase the number of household drudges, but to decrease
the amount of household drudgery; not how to do more
for domestics, but how to enable them to do more for
themselves; not how to merge the individual home into
the co-operative home or boarding house, but how to
keep it still more intact by taking out of it as far possible
that extraneous element—the domestic employee;
not how to restore the old household system, but how to
bring about adaptation to present conditions; not so
much how to persuade more persons to go into domestic
service, as to use to better advantage the time and strength
of those already engaged in it; not how to induce sewing
women in the tenement houses of New York City to engage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
in work for which they have neither the physical nor
the intellectual qualifications,<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> but how to utilize the idle
labor in boarding houses and in the homes of the so-called
middle and upper classes.</p>

<p>The statement cannot be made with too great emphasis
that no plan can be suggested that will enable a housekeeper
whose inefficient employee leaves to-day to secure
a better one to-morrow; a complicated social malady of
long standing demands time and patience to work a cure
or even a relief. Two classes of measures, however, looking
towards an improvement in the character of the service
can be suggested, the first general, the second specific.
It is believed that both classes will conform to the general
industrial and social tendencies enumerated.</p>

<p>In the first place there must be a truer conception on
the part of both men and women of the important place
that household employments occupy in the economy of
the world. The utter neglect of the subject by economic
students and writers must give place to a scientific investigation
of an employment which is at least wealth-consuming
if not wealth-producing. A very large part of
the wealth produced in the world is consumed in the
household, yet neither those who produce nor those who
consume know on what principles it is done. Time-saving
and labor-saving devices are made at enormous cost
for uses in production, while time and strength incalculable
are wasted through consumption. In no other occupation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
is there so much waste of labor and capital; in no other
would a fraction of this waste be overlooked. It is idle to
complain of poor servants and of poor mistresses so long as
domestic service is divorced from general labor questions,
and employers everywhere are ignorant of the economic
laws, principles, and conditions underlying the household.
Men and women might better give to the study of domestic
service as an occupation the time and energy that
now are absorbed in considering the vices and virtues of
individual employees.</p>

<p>This truer conception of the place of household economics
considered from the theoretical standpoint will give rise
to a more just estimate of their place in a practical way.
Those employers who “despise housekeeping,” who “cannot
endure cooking,” who “hate the kitchen,” who “will
not do menial work,” will come to regard household work
in a different light. Indeed, until the members of this
class, far too large in numbers, change either their opinion
or their occupation, it is hopeless to look for a reform in
domestic service. That “dignity of labor” so often prescribed
as a panacea for the troubles in the kitchen must
first be maintained in the parlor if reform is to come.
The simple prescription of the remedy will not effect a
cure. “To know the workman,” wrote Leclaire in 1865,
“one must have been a workman himself, and above
all <i>remember it</i>.” In a similar way the housekeeper
must have not only a knowledge of household affairs,
but a respect for them, and being presumably better
educated and equipped, she must be the one to prove
that the interests of employer and employee are the
same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span></p>

<p>Again, more systematic study of the subject in a general
way must remove much of the ignorance, as well as
of the aversion, that undoubtedly exists in regard to this
occupation. Public sentiment has not yet demanded that
when a woman assumes the care of a household she shall
possess at least a theoretical knowledge of household
affairs; it is deemed sufficient if she acquire it afterward
at an enormous cost of time, patience, energy, sometimes
even of domestic happiness. But public sentiment will
make such demand when the economic functions of
housekeeping are understood. Until a larger number of
housekeepers understand at least the rudiments of the
profession they have adopted, it is to be expected that
ignorant and inexperienced employees will waste the
substance of their employers, and fail to become skilled
laborers, and that able, intelligent, and ambitious girls will
be unwilling to enter an occupation in which the employers
are as untrained in a scientific way as are the employees.
Water cannot rise higher than its source. As long as
inefficient service is accepted inefficient service will be
rendered; as long as mistresses are ignorant of the difference
between rights and extraordinary privileges, employees,
like children, will continue to be spoiled by careless
indulgence; “as long as women hate kitchen and household
cares, and servants know that they know more than
their employers, just so long will employers everywhere
have eye-servants.”</p>

<p>A different conception must also come in regard to the
work of woman, especially where the factor of remuneration
is involved. An explanation is still needed for the
fact that idleness is practically regarded as a vice in men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
and a virtue in women;<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> that a young man is condemned
by society for saying “the world owes me a living,” while a
young woman is praised for her womanliness when she
says it by her life; that a wealthy woman must not
receive remuneration for services for which compensation
would be accepted by a wealthy man or by a poor woman.
This does not mean that all women should engage in
business enterprises, but that it should be honorable for
them to do so, dishonorable for them to be ignorant of
all means of self-support, and that they should receive
adequate remuneration for all public services performed
when men would be paid under the same circumstances.
Household employments are too often in effect, though
less often than in theory, belittled by both men and
women, and they will continue to be until there is the
freest industrial play in all occupations for women as
well as for men. As long as household employments performed
without remuneration are the only occupations
for women looked upon with favor by society at large,
just so long will this free industrial play be lacking.
One effect of this is seen in the case of very many
mothers who have been overworked and overburdened by
household cares. The pendulum swings to the opposite
end of the arc, and they declare that their daughters shall
never work at all. The children therefore grow up in
idleness and ultimately, when driven to work by necessity,
drift into shops and factories. When household employments
are removed from the domain of charity and sentiment
and put on a business basis, when the interests of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
women are broadened, when they are better able “to distinguish
between infinity and infinitesimals,” there will be
a more intelligent understanding of the financial side of
woman’s work.</p>

<p>The general remedies therefore must include a wider
prevalence of education in the true sense of the word, not
its counterfeit, information; that mental education which
results in habits of accuracy, precision, and observation,
in the exercise of reason, judgment, and self-control, and
that education of character which results in the ability
constantly to put one’s self in the place of another.
There must be scientific training and investigation in
economic theory, history, and statistics, especially in their
application to the household, and an increased popular
knowledge of all scientific subjects concerning the home,
those which secure the prevention of economic and material
waste in the household as well as those which concern
the questions of production for it. The educational
forces must “pull from the top” and draw domestic service
into the general current of industrial development.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br>
<span class="smaller">POSSIBLE REMEDIES—IMPROVEMENT IN SOCIAL CONDITION</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Certain general principles have been suggested in
accordance with which it seems reasonable to expect improvement
in domestic service to be made. Of specific
remedies, the first class to be suggested concerns the social
degradation as yet entailed by the occupation. For the
most part the oppressive conditions are the lack of all
social and educational advantages, the use of an obnoxious
epithet applied to the individuals of the class, the
universal use of the familiar Christian name in address,
the requirement of livery, enforced servility of manner,
and the offering of fees to several large subdivisions of
the class. Every one of these must seem a reasonable
objection to one who can put himself in the place of
another; they are among the weightiest arguments
against entering the service; each one can be entirely
removed, or so modified as to become unobjectionable.
It is useless to look for any improvement in the character
of domestic service until these oppressive conditions
have been removed; but it is not vain to hope for an
emancipation from them in time. The social ban has
been removed from other occupations in which women
have become wage earners—it has been removed from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
teaching,<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> the practice of medicine and law, and business
industries—women can engage in all of these without
fear of being ostracized. The relative social position of
different occupations in which men engage has also
changed. In colonial New England, the minister, not
the lawyer, had the social precedence; in the Southern
colonies the lawyer was an honored guest, while the
chaplain of the plantation was a hireling who often
married an indentured servant on the same plantation.
Dentists, men “in trade,” brewers, and veterinary
surgeons have in other localities all felt the lack of an
assured place in society. Social barriers against both
men and women are everywhere breaking down in
the presence of high character, ability, education, and
technical training; they will ultimately fall before men
and women engaged in domestic service, who can bear
these same tests of character, ability, education, and
technical training.</p>

<p>In considering the specific social disadvantages, it must
be conceded that the desire for greater social and intellectual
opportunities is most reasonable. Mr. Higginson
says in answer to the question, “Why do children dislike
history?” “The father brings home to his little son,
from the public library, the first volume of Hildreth’s
<i>United States</i>, and says to him, ‘There, my son, is a book
for you, and there are five more volumes just like it.’
He then goes back to his <i>Sunday Herald</i>, and his wife<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
reverts to <i>But Yet a Woman</i>, or <i>Mr. Isaacs</i>.” The attitude
of society towards social opportunities for domestic
employees is much the same. Society demands the theatre,
the opera, the parlor concert, the lecture, the dinner,
the afternoon tea, the yacht race, the tennis match, the
bicycle excursion, the coaching party, and expects the
class lacking at present all resources within themselves
to stay quietly at home and thus satisfy their desire for
pleasure and intellectual opportunity. Country life sometimes
proves lonely and distasteful to employers educated
in the city. Is it less so to the employee lacking the
opportunity for change enjoyed by others?<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>Comparatively little can be done in the ordinary private
home to meet these difficulties; but even if much
could be done, it is at least an open question whether this
would be the true remedy. In large establishments sitting-rooms
can be provided for employees, but such establishments
are few in number, and the fact that such
rooms are in the home of another prevents that “good
time,” the craving for which is so natural. Many employers
are glad to give personal instruction evenings,
but solitary instruction is even more defective for the
domestic than it is for the children of the family.
Enthusiasm must always come with numbers, and comparatively
little can be done for employees through this
means. But social opportunities and intellectual advantages
can be provided, as has been done so successfully<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
in the case of the employees of shops and factories.
Social life everywhere tends towards clubs, societies, and
organizations. Domestics can be encouraged to form
clubs and societies through which parlors can be provided
for social intercourse, and reading-rooms where intellectual
needs will be met. If the domestic employee
were taken from the home of the employer and encouraged
to find for herself avenues of improvement and
entertainment, her social condition would be greatly
improved. She must be made to see that the reason
why she does not rise to the social position to which she
aspires, is not because her work is degrading, but because
her conversation is often ungrammatical and lacking in
interest, her dress sometimes untidy and devoid of taste,
and her manner not always agreeable. She must do her
part towards improving her social condition. It is true,
that probably at first comparatively few domestics would
avail themselves of such privileges, <i>but just as long as
social and intellectual advantages do not exist anywhere for
this class, just so long will the intelligent and capable young
woman most needed in this occupation shun it for others
where such opportunities do exist</i>.</p>

<p>The stumbling-block in the use of the word “servant” is
easily removed. The exclusive application of this word
to domestic employees must be abolished before the class
most desired in the occupation will enter it. As has
been done in every other occupation, a word like “employer”
must be substituted for “master” and “mistress,”—terms
associated only with a system of apprenticeship or
slavery,—while “domestic,” “housekeeper,” or some other
descriptive term must be used for “general servant,” the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
words “cook,” “waitress,” and “maid” being unobjectionable
for other classes of service.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> As a matter of fact the
word as now used is inappropriate in characterizing the
work expected of an efficient domestic employee. Division
of labor has made her in reality, though not in position, not
a menial, a drudge, a slave, but a co-operator in the work
of the household. The cook who prepares the raw material
for consumption is not more a servant than is the
farmer who produces the raw material; indeed her work is
justly considered skilled labor, while that of the agricultural
laborer is often unskilled. The cook is the co-operator
with her employer in the same sense as the farmer is
a co-operator in the industrial system; and the term “servant”
as indicating a menial applies to her as little as it
does to him. New words are coined and pass into familiar
usage in a short time, old words become obsolete, new
meanings are given old terms, and it is possible in the
course of a few years to substitute for the present objectionable
usage of this word a term which will describe
more definitely the duties of the position and at the same
time remove one of the most serious obstacles in the way
of improving the character of the occupation.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span></p>

<p>The inferiority implied in the use of the Christian name
in address is less clearly seen and less easily removed because
its effects are more subtile. It may not be possible
to attempt any immediate or general change, but a compromise
is possible in giving the title to married men and
women in domestic service, since marriage is supposed to
carry with it added dignity. The Japanese custom of
addressing one’s own employees by a familiar term, but
the employees of another by a title of respect,<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> is also a
possible compromise. It seems difficult to find weighty
arguments in favor of refusing to a class of self-supporting
men and women the title of respect accorded in all
other occupations.</p>

<p>The cap and apron are in themselves not only unobjectionable,
but they have certain very definite advantages.
They are conducive to neatness and economy and moreover
form a most becoming style of dress. The picturesque
effect of both is appreciated by all young women
who take part in public charitable entertainments, it was
understood by the matrons of an earlier generation, and it
has formed the theme of many letters written on foreign
soil. No costume in itself could be more desirable or
better adapted to the work of the wearers, and a more
general rather than a more restricted use of this form of
dress should be advocated on theoretical grounds. But the
cap and apron as worn do not always indicate a desire on
the part of the wearer for neatness, economy, and tasteful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
attire, nor always an appreciation of these things on the
part of the employer. They are regarded as a traditional
badge of servitude, and while so regarded it seems unwise
to force them on those unwilling to wear them. Moreover
the cap and apron while serving admirably their
place within the house have no <i>raison d’être</i> out of doors;
the cap affords no protection from heat, cold, or storms,
and the apron is inappropriate for street wear. The cap
and apron are appropriate and desirable in all places
where they would be worn by the employer under the
same circumstances, they are inappropriate elsewhere and
hence out of taste. If employees as a class would recognize
the many advantages of the costume within doors
and adopt it universally, and if employers would accept
its limitations out of doors and abandon the requirement
of it there at all times, the vexed question of livery
would seem to be answered.</p>

<p>The servility of manner demanded—at least in public—of
all domestics is an anomaly in a country where there is
no enforced recognition of social and political superiors.
The price paid for it—high wages, poor service, constant
change, household friction—seems a heavy one and the
excuse for it small. As long as domestic service lacks
the safety valve of personal independence and the outward
expression of self-respect, just so long is there
danger of too great repression and consequent explosion.
No genuine reform in domestic service is possible while
this theory of outward servility is enforced.</p>

<p>The most objectionable of all the manifestations of
social inferiority—the feeing system—has its economic
as well as its social side and will be considered by itself
in the chapter on profit sharing in domestic service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span></p>

<p>These social barriers that now prevent so effectually
the entrance into domestic service of intelligent, well-educated,
capable, and efficient persons can all be swept
away if employers as a class are willing to make the
effort. This effort will involve in some cases the relinquishing
of a favorite theory that employees can be made
a part of the family with which they are externally connected
and, instead of this, assisting them to live their
own independent lives as citizens of the community in
a normal, happy way. It will involve in other cases
abandoning the assumption that domestic employees belong
to a separate and obnoxious class in society and
cannot be met as individuals on the same plane as
are other persons of like attainments. It will involve
in still other cases the sacrifice of that personal vanity
that is gratified by the constant presence of those deemed
to be of an inferior station. If employers are willing to
yield all of the points now often unconsciously maintained
by them in opposition to the teachings of political and
industrial history, the social objections that now hold
against domestic service as an employment will disappear.
Sir Henry Sumner Maine has well said, “The
true equality of mankind lies in the future, not in the
past.” It is this true equality of the future, not the fictitious
equality of the past, that must free domestic service
from the social ill-repute it now bears.</p>

<span class="smaller">POSSIBLE REMEDIES—SPECIALIZATION OF HOUSEHOLD EMPLOYMENTS</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The efforts to remove the social stigma that now
brands domestic service will not alone accomplish the
desired result. Another means of lessening the difficulties
in the modern household is to put all household
employments on the same business basis as all employments
outside of the household. The principles
which lie at the foundation of modern business activities
are division of labor and unconscious co-operation. This
statement does not mean that both of these principles
are carried out perfectly, but that industrial progress has
been made and is being made along these lines, that the
advance already made by household employments has
been in the same direction, and that the reforms proposed
for the household that diverge from these lines, however
wise in themselves, cannot lead to the best results because
they are out of the current of general progress.</p>

<p>In considering the historical phase of the subject, a long
list of articles was suggested<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> which were formerly made
within the household, but are now made out of the house
both better and more cheaply than they could be made at
home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span></p>

<p>A list can be drawn up of other articles made out of
the house, which if made in factories are inferior, and
if purchased through the woman’s exchanges, though
as well or even better prepared, are more expensive because
the demand for such articles made in the homes
of others has up to this time been limited. The articles
in this transitional state are vegetable and fruit canning,
the making of jellies, pickles, and preserves, the baking
of bread, cake, and pastry, the preparation of soups,
pressed meats, cold meats, ice-cream, and confectionery,
condensed, sterilized, and evaporated milk, and the making
of butter not yet abandoned in all rural homes.
The transitional list also includes the making of underclothes
for women and children, which can be made more
cheaply out of the house but not always so well; and
millinery and dressmaking, which can be done better but
at greater expense. There is every indication that all the
articles in this transitional state must soon be enumerated
among those articles made both better and more cheaply
out of the house than within.</p>

<p>A third list can be made of articles that are now seldom
if ever manufactured out of the house but which can
be made elsewhere. This list includes in the first place
bread and cake of every description; it is possible by taking
all of this work out of the house to save, considered
in the aggregate both as regards the individual and the
community, an enormous waste of time and fuel and at
the same time to secure through the application of scientific
principles articles often more uniform and superior
in quality to what can be produced in the home.<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
second class includes the preparation of all vegetables
for cooking. It is not sentiment but economic principle
that should release the human hand from performing
this part of housework, more purely mechanical and more
justly entitled to be called drudgery than any other work
carried on in the house. A few years since coffee was
roasted in every kitchen. If it has been found that an
article requiring such delicate treatment as this can be
prepared by business firms better than it can be in
the household oven, there can be no serious obstacle in
the way of delivering at the door all vegetables ready
for cooking.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> Compensation for the additional cost at
first incurred would be found in the hygienic advantage
of removing from many cellars the supply of winter vegetables.
A third class of articles includes the preparation of
all cold meats, half-cooked meats, as croquettes, all stuffed
meats, as fowl and game, all “made” dishes, as salads and
cold desserts, and the cooking of all articles which need
only heating to make ready for use. The careful study
of a large number of elaborate menus as well as of more
simple bills of fare shows a very small proportion of articles
which could not be made out of the house and sent
in ready for use or requiring only the application of heat.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
The Aladdin oven constructed on scientific principles
renders the cooking and heating of food a most simple
matter. The sending of hot food to individual homes
has in no case as far as can be learned proved a success,
but the delivery of all articles ready for the final application
of heat is possible through business enterprise and
scientific experiment.</p>

<p>This partial, although not entire, solution of the problem
of domestic service, by taking a large number of
servants out of the house and by having a large part
of the work now done by them in the house done elsewhere,
is in direct line with the progress made in other
occupations.</p>

<p>It was estimated by Mr. Gallatin in 1810<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> that two-thirds
of the clothing worn in the United States was the
product of family manufacturing—then in a flourishing
state. During the twenty years following, a part of this
family weaving and spinning was transferred to factories,
and this transfer created the great factory industry. Its
rapid growth was due to the fact that the power loom
and the factory took the place of the hand loom and of
home manufacturing. A similar change has taken place
in the manufacture of cheese. Until about 1830 all
cheese was made at home, and in 1860 not more than
twenty cheese factories had been built.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> After that time
factories multiplied rapidly, until now practically all
cheese is factory made. The demand for ready-made
clothing for men was a generation ago very small. It
grew out of a demand on the part of sailors, and was increased
in large proportions at the time of the Civil War;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
the manufacture of such articles is now so firmly established
in our industrial system that a return to the home
system of manufacturing, even in the most isolated and
primitive communities, would be as impossible as the
revival of the spinning wheel. The demand for ready-made
clothing for women is nearly as great and is annually
increasing through the facilities offered by all large
retail houses for shopping by mail. The tailoress and
the maker of shirts have disappeared from the homes of
their employers and have set up establishments of their
own, or have become responsible to large business houses;
the dressmaker and the seamstress are fast following in
their footsteps, and the cook must set her face in the same
direction.</p>

<p>The trend in this direction can be seen in many ways.
The growing prevalence of camping has increased the
demand for articles of food ready for use, and even tea,
coffee, and soups are delivered hot for the benefit of pleasure
seekers.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> The development of Western resources by
Eastern capitalists has also increased the demand for
such articles, and at least one housekeeper among the
Black Hills of South Dakota, one hundred miles from a
railroad station, speaks casually of doing her marketing in
Chicago, and a housekeeper in North Carolina gives frequent
and elaborate lunches through caterers in Philadelphia.
The tendency even among persons of moderate
means is more and more towards the employment of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
caterers for special afternoon and evening entertainments,
although in villages and small towns this course as yet
involves the employment of persons from large cities.
The practice is not uncommon for the women connected
with church organizations to hold every Saturday afternoon
sales for the benefit of the society, of all articles of
food that can be prepared the previous day for Sunday
dinners and teas.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>The most important medium for the sale of such commodities
is the Woman’s Exchange.<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> It has already
become an economic factor of some little importance,
and it will become of still greater importance when it is
taken out of the domain of charity and sentiment and
becomes self-supporting on a business basis. One of its
most valuable results is that it has set a high standard
for work and has insisted that this standard be reached
by every consignor, not only once or generally, but invariably.
It has maintained this standard in the face of
hostile criticism and the feeling that a charitable organization<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
ought to accept poor work if those presenting
it are in need of money. It has shown that success
in work cannot be attained by a simple desire for it
or need of it pecuniarily. It has taught that accuracy,
scientific knowledge, artistic training, habits of observation,
good judgment, courage, and perseverance are better
staffs in reaching success than reliance upon haphazard
methods and the compliments of flattering friends. It
has raised the standard of decorative and artistic needle
work by incorporating into its rules a refusal to accept
calico patchwork, wax, leather, hair, feather, rice, splatter,
splinter, and cardboard work. It has taught many
women that a model recipe for cake is not “A few eggs,
a little milk, a lump of butter, a pinch of salt, sweetening
to taste, flour enough to thicken; give a good beating
and bake according to judgment.”</p>

<p>But still more it has opened up to women what has
been practically a new occupation. Domestic work
within the house performed by members of the family
without fixed compensation and by those not members
of the family with compensation had been the previous
rule. The Exchange has shown that it is possible for
the women of a family to prepare within the house for
sale outside many articles for table consumption, both
those of necessity and luxury. Innumerable instances
are on record of women who within the past fifteen years
have supported themselves wholly or in part by making
for general sale or on orders different articles for the
table.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span></p>

<p>It seems inevitable that eventually all articles of food
will be prepared out of the house except those requiring
the last application of heat, and that scientific skill will
reduce to a minimum the labor and expense of this final
stage of preparation. This change is in direct line with the
tendency towards specialization everywhere else found in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
that it thus becomes possible for every person to do exclusively
that thing which he or she can do best; it allows
the concentration of labor and capital and thus by economizing
both secures the largest results; it permits many
women to retain their home life and at the same time
engage in remunerative business; it improves the quality
of all articles consumed, since they are produced under
the most favorable conditions; it brings the work of
every cook into competition with the work of every
other cook by providing a standard of measurement
now lacking and thus inciting improvement; it is the
application of the principle of unconscious co-operation
and therefore in harmony with other business activities.
More definitely, as one illustration, it permits all fruits
to be canned, pickled, and preserved in every way in
the locality where they are produced at a cost ultimately
less than can now be done when fruit is shipped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
to cities and there sold at prices including high rents;
it prevents a glut in the market of such perishable articles
by providing for their preservation on farms and
in villages and subsequent transportation to cities at
leisure; it makes it possible to utilize many abandoned
farms in the East which could be used as fruit farms but
are too remote from shipping centres to permit the transportation
of ripe fruit; it ultimately lightens the labors
of many women on farms by enabling them to purchase
in cities many articles now produced by them at a disadvantage.
The canning in cities, by individual families,
of fruits, often in an over-ripe condition, is as anomalous
as would be to-day the making of dairy products in city
homes. The preservation of fruit is but one example of
articles that could be prepared better and more cheaply
in the country than in the city. Miscellaneous articles
of every description, as plum-pudding, boned turkey,
chicken broth, jelly, croquettes and salad, minced meat,
pressed veal, bouillon, calf’s-foot jelly, pure fruit juices,
blackberry cordial, and a score of other articles, could be
added to the list.</p>

<p>It is sometimes objected that this plan of taking out of
the house to as great an extent as possible all forms of
cooking lessens the individuality of the home by requiring
all persons to have the same articles of food. But the
objection presupposes a limited variety of articles, while
the method suggested must result in an unlimited variety,
as has been the case in regard to articles used for wearing
apparel since the custom has been established of having
so many made out of the house. It presupposes also
that individuality depends on externals. The gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
who wishes to preserve his individuality through his
cook could also preserve it through employing a private
tailor, but he gladly sacrifices it in the latter case for
the better work of one who serves a hundred other
customers as well. Individuality is preserved when a
person builds his own house, but the doubtful benefit of
the result is suggested by Oliver Wendell Holmes when
he says, “probably it is better to be built in that way
than not to be built at all.” The individuality of the
present generation is certainly not less than that of the
preceding one when all clothing worn by a family was
made up in the house, or of an earlier one when all cloth
was spun and woven, as well as made up, in the house, or
of a still more remote one when our ancestors troubled
themselves comparatively little about either the weaving
or the making. The very perfection of the principle of
the division of labor makes possible the expression of the
greatest individuality in that it offers the possibility of
selection from a hundred varieties whereas before no
choice was given. The ability to choose between the
work of a hundred cooks permits a truer individuality
than does the command of the services of but one.
Whims, caprices, and eccentricities sometimes masquerade
as individuality and are not always entitled to respect.</p>

<p>Another form of work now done in the house that
could be done outside is laundry work. The inconveniences
resulting from the derangement of the household
machinery according to the present method have formed
the theme of many jests; a serious consideration of the
subject must lead to the conclusion that this system
results in great waste as well as in unnecessary wear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
and tear of the household machinery. An objection on
hygienic grounds is sometimes made to the proposal to
have articles of clothing laundered out of the house together
with articles sent by other families. But science
has already accomplished much at the bidding of business
enterprise, and this objection can be overcome. Even as
it is the question may well be asked whether the price
paid is not a heavy one for individual laundresses. The
vast army of persons who board are compelled to send out
articles to be laundried, and this is apparently done without
serious results. A beginning has been made in many
families where a competent laundress cannot be secured
by sending to public laundries all starched clothing,
especially all collars and cuffs. The laundries of Troy,
New York, have branches for the reception and delivery
of goods in all parts of the country, and laundry many
articles better and more cheaply than can be done at
home. The amount of space now occupied in cities for
laundering purposes that could be used for business or
for homes is far from inconsiderable. It seems not altogether
unreasonable to believe that if the space now occupied
by laundries in individual homes could be used for
other purposes rents would be perceptibly lower. On
economic grounds alone this generation should relegate
the washing machine and the wringer to the attic or the
front parlor, where it has already placed the spinning
wheel of its ancestors.</p>

<p>Still another field is open for business enterprise in
connection with the household. A very large part of the
work connected with it concerns the care of the house and
grounds. This includes the semi-annual housecleaning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
and the cleaning of windows, floors, brass, silver, and
lamps; the sweeping, dusting, and general care of rooms,
including the special attention that must be given to
books, pictures, and bric-à-brac; the care of lawns, walks,
porches, and furnaces; the repairing of articles of clothing
and furniture; table service and chamber service.
Here again economic tendencies are showing themselves.
Much if not all of this work can be done by the piece or
by the hour, and men and women are everywhere taking
advantage of the fact.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> A very large part of the work of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
the household can be thus done, especially if housekeepers
are willing to waive the tradition that silver must
be cleaned on Thursdays, sweeping done on Fridays, and
all sleeping-rooms put in order before nine o’clock in the
morning.</p>

<p>One other measure of relief concerns the purchase of
supplies. Marketing is a science and might be made a
profession. At present it is usually done in a haphazard,
make-shift fashion. It is done by the head of the household
on his way to business and thus done in haste; or
orders are given through a clerk who goes from house to
house and thus serves primarily the firm he represents,
while at the same time the purchaser loses the benefit
of competition in the markets; or commissions are given
by telephone and the customer has no opportunity of
inspecting the goods before purchase; or marketing is
done by the mistress of the household, who is unable to
reach the markets in time to make her purchases with
the care that should be given; or it is done by the cook,
who may know the best articles to purchase but is ignorant
of their money value. It requires time, skill, and
experience to purchase judiciously the supplies for a
household, and in many households time, skill, and experience
are lacking. It would seem possible for one
person to do the marketing for fifteen or twenty families,
taking the orders at night and executing them in the
morning. Supplies could then be purchased in quantity,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
this gain would pay the commission of the purchaser,
and marketing would be done in a much more
satisfactory manner than it is at the present time. At
the same time such a plan would relieve the members
of individual households of the burden and care of a
difficult part of household management.</p>

<p>All of these measures suggested must tend ultimately
to take as far as possible the domestic employee out of
the house, letting her perform her work through the
operation of unconscious business co-operation. This
method would enable a large number of women to go
into household employments who have ability in this
direction but who now drift into other occupations which
permit them to maintain their own home life. It is generally
assumed that an unmarried woman has no desire
for a home and no need of a place that she can call her
own. When she goes into domestic employment, therefore,
she must merge her individual life into that of her
employer and relinquish all the social instincts, although
as strong in her as in another. But this is what many
are not willing to do. If the opportunity were presented
of performing housework and remaining at home,
large numbers would in time enter the work. Many
who have no homes would still be glad to share the
home of an employer, but where no alternative is presented,
as under the present system, except where
negroes are employed, the requirement of residence becomes
irksome and is a hindrance in this as it would
be in any other industry. It is also true that many
employees particularly dislike to live in flats. The
sleeping accommodations are generally poor, with little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
light or ventilation, and all parts of the household are
cramped and crowded. To take the employee out of
the modern flat and let her go to her own home or
lodging place would be a boon to both employer and
employee. The plan proposed also lessens materially
the amount of care and responsibility now incurred by
the employer, since it decreases the number of personal
employees. The presence of the employee in the family
is a disadvantage to the household of the employer as
well as to the employee. Again, it enables large numbers
of women who have only a few hours each day or
week to give to outside work to do it in their own houses
or in the homes of others without neglect of their own
households. Moreover, it lessens much of the difficulty
that now exists owing to the migratory habits of the modern
family. The question of what shall be done with the
employees of a household during the summer and how
new ones shall be secured in the autumn is answered
in a measure if the work performed by them can be
done by the piece, hour, or season and a large part of
the family supplies can be purchased ready for use.
Then, too, it renders both employer and employee more
independent. Whether the desire for independence is
right or wrong is not the question—it is a condition
and must be met.</p>

<p>It has often been pointed out that the aristocracy of
the Church broke down at the time of the Reformation,
that the aristocracy of the State was overthrown by the
Bastile mob, that aristocracy in education is yielding to
the democratic influences of university extension, and
that aristocratic economics are disappearing in the light<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
of the industrial discussions of the day. The aristocracy
of the household must succumb to this universal desire
for personal independence on the part of employees.</p>

<p>The plan suggested of specializing household industries
to as great an extent as possible and encouraging the
domestic employee to live in her own home has much in
its favor. It substitutes for the responsibility to an individual
employer, so irritating to many and so contrary to
the industrial spirit of the age, the responsibility to a
business firm. It throws the responsibility for success
on the individual employees by bringing them into more
immediate competition with other workers in the same
field. It provides a channel through which advance
becomes possible and also independent business life if
executive ability is present. It reduces house rent in
proportion as the number of employees is lessened, or it
places at the disposal of the family a larger portion of the
house than is now available for their personal uses. It
simplifies the problem in all families where there is more
work than can be done by one employee but not enough
for two. It makes possible such a division of labor in
the household as will discriminate between skilled and
unskilled labor. Under the present system the employer
expects to find in one individual for $3 per week and
expenses, a French chef, an Irish laundress, a discreet
waitress, a Yankee maid-of-all-work, a parlor maid
a Quaker in neatness, all this, “with the temper of a
saint and the constitution of a cowboy thrown in.” Expectations
are often disappointed and the blame is thrown,
not on a bad system, but on the individual forced to carry
it out. The separation of skilled and unskilled labor permits<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
each one to do a few things well and prevents the
friction inevitable when the skilled workman is called
upon to do unskilled work, or the unskilled laborer to
perform tasks requiring the ability of an expert. It is a
more flexible system of co-operation than the one technically
known as such, since all articles are purchased, not
of a certain manufacturer or dealer whom it has been
agreed upon by contract to patronize, but wherever it is
most convenient. It is easily adapted to the present system
of living in flats and apartment houses rendered
almost necessary in some places by high rents; this way
of living makes it difficult to employ a large number of
domestics, but on the other hand it makes it possible to
do without them. It enables the domestic employee to
have the daily change in going back and forth from her
work which the shop-girl and the factory-girl now have.
The domestic employee now has out-of-door exercise not
oftener than once or twice a week, and the effect is as
deleterious physically, mentally, and morally as a similar
course would be in other walks of life. It must decrease
that pernicious habit, so degrading to the occupation as
well as to the individual, of discussing the personal characteristics
of both employers and employees, since the
relationship between the two is changed from the personal
to the business one. It elevates to the rank of
distinct occupations many classes of housework now considered
drudgery because done at odd moments by overworked
employees. It must in time result in many
economic gains, one illustration of which is the fact that
the kitchen could be heated by the furnace and all cooking
done by kerosene, gas, or electricity; on the other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
hand, the necessities of employers would cease to be the
gauge for measuring the minimum of work that could be
done by employees without losing their places.</p>

<p>Two objections are sometimes raised to this plan. The
first is that the cost of living would be increased. This
would undoubtedly be the effect at first, but it is not a
valid objection to this mode of housekeeping. The list
of articles now made out of the house shows that every
article of men’s dress is made more cheaply and better
than formerly when made at home. This is due to the
fact that in the transitional period men of means were
willing to pay a higher price for goods made out of the
house for the sake of obtaining a superior article. Competition
subsequently made it possible for men of moderate
means to share in the same benefit. The same tendency
is seen among wage-earning women. They could make
their own dresses at less expense than they can hire them
made, but it would be done at a loss of time and strength
taken from their own work, and they prefer to employ
others. Moreover cost of living is a relative term—an
increase in the family income makes it possible to employ
more service and therefore to live better than before.
Families of wealth now have two alternatives, either to
employ more domestics within the home, or to purchase
more ready-made supplies. The alternative usually
chosen is the former, but if such families would choose
the second and instead of employing additional domestics
would, as far as practicable, purchase ready-made supplies
for the table and have more work done by the hour, day,
or piece, as great ease of living would be secured as
through the employment of additional service within the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
house under the present system. Though the cost of
living might be increased, it is a price many would be
glad to pay for a release from the friction of a retinue of
domestics in the home. When it has become the custom
for families of wealth to have few or no domestics under
their own roofs, the great problem of how people of limited
incomes can have comfortable homes will be solved.</p>

<p>The second objection is the fact that it would take
from the women of the household much of their work.
The problem, however, has not been to provide a means
of excusing from their legitimate share in the work of
the world one half of its population, but to use that labor
at the least cost of time and strength. The argument
that would maintain the present system because it provides
women with work is the same as that which destroyed
the machines of Arkwright and Crompton;
it is the argument that keeps convicts in idleness lest
their work should come into competition with the work
of others; it is the opposition always shown to every
change whereby the number of workers in any field is at
first lessened. But the plan proposed does not contemplate
abolishing household work for women, but changing
its direction so that it may be more productive with less
expenditure than at present. It calls for specialization of
work on a business basis, rather than idleness or charity.
It asks that the woman who can bake bread better than
she can sweep a room should, through unconscious co-operation,
bake bread for several families and hire her
sweeping done for her by one who can do it better than
she. It asks that the woman who likes to make cake and
fancy desserts but dislikes table service should dispose of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
the products of her labor to several employers, rather than
give her time to one employer and do in addition other
kinds of work in which she does not excel. It asks that
the woman who cannot afford to buy her preserves and
jellies at the Woman’s Exchange but crochets for church
fairs slippers that are sold at a dollar a pair shall dispose
of the products of her industry at a remunerative rate
and buy her jellies put up in a superior manner. The
plan allows the person who has skill in arranging tables
and likes dining-room work, but dislikes cooking, to do
this special kind of work, when otherwise she would drift
into some other light employment. It provides that
women in their own homes who are now dependent for
support on the labors of others shall have opened to them
some remunerative occupation. The preparation of food
in small quantities always secures more satisfactory results
than when it is prepared in larger amounts. Women
in their own homes can give foods the delicate handling
necessary for the best results and at the same time use
the spare hours that are now given to unprofitable tasks.
It makes every member of the family a co-operator in
some form in the general family life. What is needed
indeed in the household is more co-operation among the
different members of it rather than conscious co-operation
with different families. It has been recently pointed out
that the carrying of electricity as a motive power to individual
houses may cause a partial return to the domestic system
of manufacturing which will be carried on under more
favorable conditions than was the old domestic system.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
This is in the future—its possibility is only hinted at.
But the domestic system of housework, if that expression
may be used to distinguish it from the present individual
system, and the proposed system of unconscious co-operation,
enables women to work in their own homes and, by
exchange of such commodities and services as each can
best dispose of, to contribute to the general welfare.</p>

<p>The plan of specialization of household employments
has already been put into partial operation by many
housekeepers and its success attested by those who have
tried it.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> Conscious co-operative housekeeping has in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
nearly every case proved a practical failure, but the
unconscious co-operation that comes through business
enterprise has brought relief to the household in many
directions and it is one of the lines along which progress
in the future must be made.</p>

<span class="smaller">POSSIBLE REMEDIES—PROFIT SHARING</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Domestic service, as has been seen, is accompanied by
certain social conditions that prevent many from entering
the occupation. The present unclassified state of
household employments operates in the same way. But
in addition to this lack of organization, other industrial
disadvantages are found. These are the lack of all
opportunity for promotion within the service, the lack of
kindred occupations opening out from it, the irregularity
of working hours, and confinement evenings and Sundays,
the necessary competition between those of American
birth and foreign born and colored employees, and
the lack of personal independence. These, in addition
to the unorganized condition of the work, are the industrial
disadvantages that tell most strongly against the
occupation; they are the economic maladies that can be
alleviated only by the application of economic remedies.</p>

<p>The attempt has been made to show how the lack of
organization in household employments can be partially
met by taking out of the house a large part of the work
now performed there, and having much of what must
necessarily remain done by the piece, hour, day, or season,
thus securing better specialization of work and directing
it into the current of industrial progress. The second<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
group of industrial difficulties enumerated must in a
similar way be met by measures that have proved successful
in similar fields.</p>

<p>The vexed questions of wages and hours of labor in the
industrial world are still unsettled, but in certain industries
some little progress towards a solution of those difficulties
has been made through the introduction of the
profit-sharing system. In order to answer the question
whether profit sharing could be introduced with advantage
into domestic service, it is necessary to consider
somewhat in detail the question, What is profit sharing,
and also the question, What have been its advantages in
general economic society?</p>

<p>Profit sharing, as defined by Mr. Carroll D. Wright, is the
term that “may be applied to any arrangement whereby
labor is rewarded in addition to its wages, or in lieu of
wages, by participation in the profits of the business in
which it is employed. Benefits of various kinds—as
insurance, schools, libraries, and beautiful surroundings,
so far as maintained by employers out of their
profits and enjoyed by employees as an addition to what
their wages would purchase—would have to be regarded,
in a strict analysis, as an indirect form of profit sharing.”<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>
Mr. Nicholas Payne Gilman defines it as “the method of
rewarding labor by assigning it a share in the realized
profits of business in addition to wages.”<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> Mr. D. F.
Schloss considers it “an arrangement under which an
employer agrees with his employees that they shall receive,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
in partial remuneration of their labor, and in addition
to their ordinary wages, a share, fixed beforehand,
in the profits of his business.”<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> The International Congress
on Profit Sharing, held in Paris, in 1889, declared
it to be “a voluntary agreement, by virtue of which an
employee receives a share, fixed beforehand, in the profits
of an undertaking.”</p>

<p>The history of profit sharing is short, and can easily be
recalled. It began in 1842 with the <i>Maison Leclaire</i> in
Paris, and has been subsequently introduced into many
business houses in France and Switzerland, countries
where the economic conditions lend themselves readily
to its progress. Its adoption in Germany has been less
extensive, while the English industrial system has hitherto
seemed hostile to it, although Mr. D. F. Schloss in his
recent Report claims that a larger number of experiments
in profit sharing have been made in England than in any
other country. Probably about one fourth of the business
establishments conducted on this principle are found
in the United States.</p>

<p>What are the advantages that have resulted from this
fifty years of more or less extensive experience with the
system? There is first the fact that it results in the development
of what Mr. Carroll D. Wright has called
“the group of industrial virtues.” This group includes
diligence, zeal, caretaking, vigilance, punctuality, fidelity,
continuity of effort, willingness to learn, a spirit of co-operation,
and a personal interest in all business affairs.
In addition to these virtues, other positive advantages
have been noted by those who have tried the system.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
“An appreciable percentage of the occasions of worry,
which all large employers experience, have disappeared,”
writes Mr. T. W. Bushill, of Coventry, England.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> M. Billon,
of Geneva, states as one result of his experiment,
“Superintendence became easy for us, and <i>from that time
we could, without fear of offending any one, show ourselves
exacting in details to which previously we were obliged to
close our eyes</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> The Peace Dale Manufacturing Company
began profit sharing “not to make money in the
positive sense, but to save waste.”<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> This saving of
waste is seen in the efforts to economize time and materials
and in the additional care with which machinery
and all appliances for work are used. Various English
firms have been most successful in attaining this end,
stating that they find “increasing care to avoid spoilt
work and waste both of time and material”; that “waste
is guarded against”; that there is care in handling
materials, and that “especially waste of raw material is
avoided.”<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> Another gain is found in the identification
of the interests of employer and employees and the consequent
harmony between capital and labor; “the occurrence
of a strike in a profit-sharing establishment is
believed to have been a rare event,” says Mr. Schloss.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>
The advantage to the employer of this identification of
interest is seen in the ability to obtain “a steadier and
superior class of workers”; in the fact that “the knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
that there is such a scheme brings all the best workmen”
to the firm employing it; that “workers remain
year after year”; and that “it tends to secure and retain
the best workers.” Its good effects on the character
of the work are seen when “an efficient man is very
soon pricked up to greater diligence by his fellow workers”;
in securing through it “the maximum of effort”;
“in a steady pulling up all around”; when it “makes the
men keener after business and sharper in keeping down
expenses.”<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>It would seem difficult to introduce the scheme into a
business like that of tea-blending, but a London firm that
has practised it thirteen years states that the effect is
“to make the clerks willing to exert themselves in an
especial manner, when the occasion arises, because they
know that if they show themselves unable to cope with
the mass of work to be done, then the staff must be
increased; and they do not care to see their bonus diminished
by an augmentation of the numbers entitled to
participation.”<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p>The question naturally arises as to how far these gains
reimburse the employer for the financial cost of profit
sharing. The chairman of the South Metropolitan Gas
Company of London writes, “I state unhesitatingly that
the Company is recouped the whole of the amounts—some
£40,000—paid as a bonus since the system was
started.”<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> The managing director of the New Welsh
Slate Quarry Company gives it as his personal belief<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
“that we are recouping every penny of bonus and more;”
and similar testimony comes from others.</p>

<p>Yet this is putting the matter on the lowest plane.
The system “converts the industrial association of employer
and employees into a moral organism, in which
all the various talents, services, and desires of the component
individuals are fused into a community of purpose
and endeavor.”<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> A natural result, moreover, is a general
elevation in the standards of morals. Most of all, in an
individual way it is of help to the employee; “to assist
a person in improving his condition by his own efforts is
to make a man of him.”<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p>What can be learned from these successful experiences
in profit sharing that will be of value in domestic service?
The usual difficulties that beset the employer of domestic
labor are lack of interest, desire for change, negligence,
waste of time, extravagance in the use of materials,
in a word, the absence of the industrial virtues. If these
very difficulties—all of which exist elsewhere—are partially
or entirely obviated by the employer of other forms
of labor through the system of profit sharing, may it not
reasonably be expected that they could be met in domestic
service by the employment of similar means?</p>

<p>Domestic service, it is true, is not a wealth-producing
occupation, but it is wealth-consuming probably beyond
any other employment. The profit, therefore, must be
negative, that is, economy in the use of time, materials,
and appliances for work. It is in precisely these ways
that profit sharing has been most successful, and the wage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
system most unsatisfactory. Under the wage system the
employer of domestic labor pays for time rather than for
quality of service, and employers therefore constantly
complain that employees do not accomplish one half as
much as they should, and employees that employers exact
twice as much as can be done. Neither party to the contract
under the wage system can have a true notion of the
working value or the money value of time; thus it is not
strange that the one requires more than can be performed,
and the other does less than might be reasonably demanded.
The same ignorance and carelessness prevails in the use
of materials. The employer may provide the best the
markets afford, but if the cook has never had brought
home to her a realizing sense of the money value of these
materials, she is not altogether to blame if she fries
doughnuts in butter costing fifty cents a pound, and
makes angel food daily when eggs are forty cents a
dozen. The employer may also provide the finest of
furnishings for the dining-room and china closet, but if
the maid-of-all-work does not associate a money value
with these furnishings, she uses table napkins for holders,
and carelessly drops fine china into an iron sink. From
the selfish point of view the chief interest of the employer
is to keep the bills down and to get the greatest possible
amount of service even at the cost of the greatest expenditure
of human strength; among employees, it is to do
sufficient work to retain a good place, and to use whatever
materials are most convenient.</p>

<p>Mr. Nicholas Payne Gilman has well said, “The deficiency
in the daily wage system as a motive power to procure
the desirable maximum of effort and performance is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
extreme.” Precisely the same objections that hold in all
other employments to the wage system hold as well in
domestic service. In other occupations it has been seen
that the almost universal testimony of those who have
tried profit sharing is that the system results in economy
in the use of materials, care in the handling of machinery
and implements of work, and a feeling of partnership, the
spur of which as a motive “is only excelled in sharpness
by complete proprietorship.” Mr. Gilman sums up the
advantages of the system when he says, “Profit sharing
advances the prosperity of an establishment by increasing
the quantity of the product, by improving the quality, by
promoting care of implements and economy of materials,
and by diminishing labor difficulties and the cost of superintendence.”
In a word, whatever arguments can be
advanced in favor of profit sharing in productive industries
can be used with equal force in its favor in domestic
service.</p>

<p>The application of the principle to the household is
simple. It is possible to allow a fixed sum, as $50, $100,
or $500 per month for living expenses, which shall include
the purchase of all food for the table, fuel, lights, ice,
breakages, and the replacement of worn-out kitchen utensils,
and to allow a pro rata amount for guests during the
month. If by care in the use of food materials, fuel, and
kitchen and dining-room furniture, the expenses amount
to $45, $90, or $450 per month, the $5, $10, or $50 saved
can be divided according to a ratio previously agreed
upon between the employer and the one or more employees.
The cook is in the position to save the most,
and therefore ought to receive the greatest percentage of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
the amount saved; but it is a part of the work of the
waitress to be careful of glass and china, of the laundress
not to waste fuel, soap, and starch, and of all, including
parlor maid, seamstress, and nursery maid, not to waste
gas, fuel, or food at the table, and therefore each employee
is entitled to a share in the profits. Thus each keeps
watch over the others to prevent undue waste, and the
employees are given a personal interest in the establishment
now so often lacking. In addition to this, it is possible
to allow a gardener and a coachman who have taken
special care in the improvement of lawns, gardens, and
stables a small percentage on the annual appreciation of
property. “Comprehension is wonderfully quickened by
the payment of a bonus or two in cash, and there is no
more efficient instructor than self-interest.”</p>

<p>Moreover, it is possible to allow a fixed sum for service,
as $18 per month, out of which the employee may choose
to have a small sum spent in hiring by the day some one
to wash windows and clean verandas, or she may choose to
economize her time and strength and do this work herself.
In either case the financial outcome to the employer
is the same, while either arrangement makes the employee
a partner in the domestic company and gives her an active
interest in its welfare.</p>

<p>It is possible to apply the principle in still other ways.
If the general servant likes to cook but dislikes other
parts of housework, she may contribute to the Woman’s
Exchange and with part of the money received hire with
her employer an assistant to come in a certain number of
hours each day to care for the rooms, the silver and brass,
and wait on the table. It is possible also to give the cook<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
a certain amount of time for making articles to be sold at
the Woman’s Exchange, the employer furnishing capital
and implements of work and receiving a certain share in
the profits. In employment bureaus it would be possible
to give a certain percentage of the profits of the bureau
to all employees who have kept their names on the books
of the bureau and remained at least one year in the place
found by them through its agency.</p>

<p>The ways indeed are numberless in which the principle
of profit sharing can be applied; and if the ingenuity and
fertility of resource possessed by so many employers were
once turned in this direction, the good resulting would be
incalculable.</p>

<p>Great as would be the gain for domestic service if this
principle could be adopted in private families, the advantage
would be if possible even greater could it be introduced
into hotels, boarding houses, and restaurants, and
also the dining-car, parlor-car, and sleeping-car service.
In all hotels, restaurants, and public institutions the
waste is enormous—perhaps proportionately greater than
in private families, largely because as a rule the superintendents
of such establishments are also employees on
wages. Ignorance is often the chief cause of waste, and
the best corrective of this ignorance is the experience
gained through profit sharing.</p>

<p>But the greatest advantage of profit sharing in restaurants
and hotels, dining-cars and sleeping-cars, is that
through it the feeing system could be abolished. In all
such business enterprises where the feeing system is established
there is in effect a combination of the general
public and the employees of the establishments against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
the proprietors of them. Such is the case because the
feeing system prevents the proprietors from receiving a
fair amount of patronage unless each employee is feed for
performing the service he ought freely to give and for
which he will presumably be paid by his employer. The
money profit in all these establishments depends largely
on the good service rendered by the employees, and thus
it would be possible to divide a positive profit as well as
a negative saving. The feeing system, if it prevails in
any branch of personal service, drags down with it in the
social and industrial scale every other branch of the service.
The substitution of profit sharing in hotels and
restaurants and in the dining-car and sleeping-car service
for the system of fees so increasingly prevalent would
do more than any other one thing to remove the social
stigma from domestic service and make of all such employees
self-respecting men and women.</p>

<p>It may be urged against the proposition to introduce
profit sharing into domestic service that few employees
are of such stability of character as to warrant making
the experiment. But the great desideratum is to introduce
into the service some principle that will develop the
best qualities of those already in it, that will sift out the
worthless and compel them to undertake unskilled labor,
that will draw from other occupations, where they are less
needed, able persons whose natural tastes and abilities
would attract them to this. M. Levasseur is quoted as
saying that of one hundred firms that begin business,
ten per cent succeed, fifty per cent “vegetate,” and forty
per cent go into bankruptcy. The statement characterizes
with possibly sufficient accuracy the result in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
case of the establishment of a corresponding number of
households. Could an industrial partnership be formed
between employer and employee, with the agreement to
divide, not positive profits, but negative savings, something
might be done to save the forty per cent who now
give up housekeeping and go into the bankruptcy of
hotels and boarding houses, and also to lessen the fifty
per cent who “vegetate” through the employment in the
household of obsolete industrial methods.</p>

<p>It may also be said that profit sharing appeals to a
selfish motive and therefore is objectionable. But much
of the waste and extravagance in the household comes
from ignorance; profit sharing is one way of teaching
the value of raw materials. The comfortable theory is
often entertained that to be born poor is to be born with
a knowledge of all household affairs. As a matter of
fact, there is doubtless far more waste and extravagance
in the households of the poor than in those of the rich.
But extravagance is in reality a relative term; “tenderloin
steak for breakfast and rump roast for dinner,”
which may be simple fare in the household of the employer,
becomes an impossible luxury to the employee in
such a family when she goes to a home of her own.
Profit sharing would be of value in the household not
because it would appeal to a selfish motive, but because it
would teach the value of materials used and incidentally
do something to prevent this prevalent waste and extravagance.</p>

<p>Neither of these objections to profit sharing holds in
the face of all that can be said in its favor. The general
arguments for it are many. It is usually assumed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
that the interests of the employer and those of the employee
are antagonistic. The introduction of profit sharing
could easily prove that this assumption in domestic
service is wrong, as it has already made similar proof in
other occupations. If the employers of other forms of
labor find themselves relieved of much of the worry and
friction that have previously resulted from the mutual
relation of employer and employee, it would seem reasonable
to expect a like result in the household. If it has
been found elsewhere that the extra services called out,
and the manner in which they are called out, constitute
an invaluable educational discipline, and promote zeal,
efficiency, and economy, a similar result might be looked
for here. If other employees have learned through it to
be careful of their methods of work, punctual in the performance
of their duties, and economical in the use of
materials; if it has become “a moral educator, and substituted
harmony and mutual good-will for distrust and
contention in the relations of employer and employee,”
then, indeed, may it not be considered, not as a panacea,
but as one measure among many that may be of help in
lessening some of the serious difficulties that now attend
domestic service?</p>

<p>At the present time a public discussion of domestic
service meets with little else but jest and ridicule, while
in private life the social stigma is cast on all engaged in
it, as is the case in no other occupation. To attempt to
dignify labor by saying, “we must dignify labor,” savors
of the old problem of trying to raise one’s self by the
boot-straps. No concrete method by which this is to be
done is ever suggested, and until some plan is adopted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
by which the personal dignity and independence of the
employee is recognized, and his industrial and financial
independence is secured, domestic service will continue
to be under the industrial and social ban. When this
improved condition is brought about, there will be established
what Professor Jevons considers the best of all
trade-unions—that between the employer and employee.</p>

<p>It must be frankly said that the plan of adopting profit
sharing in the household is a theoretical one; and to say
it is “mere theory” is often considered an unanswerable
argument with which to meet every new proposition.
But theory lies at the basis of all successful action; difficulties
have come in household service often because it
has been conducted without theory—in a short-sighted,
haphazard, hand-to-mouth fashion. It is known, however,
that the experiment has been tried successfully in
a private family, and this perhaps saves the proposition
from the charge of being only theory. It has been tried
by Mrs. X, a university graduate, after one and a half
years’ experience in housekeeping. The experiment was
made in a college town where the cost of provisions was
rather above than below the average. The family comprised
four adults, including the Irish maid rather above
the average in intelligence and ambition. The plan provided
for an allowance of $40 a month for living expenses,
including groceries, meats, fish, poultry, butter,
milk, cream, ice, candles, kerosene oil, and incidental
expenses. The last included breakage and the replacement
of worn-out kitchen utensils. The best materials
of all kinds were purchased, and practically nothing was
ever thrown away. The food was simple but abundant.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
The co-operation between employer and maid consisted
on the part of the employer in planning the menu, especially
the making up of left-over materials, the pricing of
all articles in the market, and keeping the accounts accurately;
the maid gave all orders and carried them out.
The profit sharing consisted in dividing equally between
employer and maid whatever had been saved at the end
of the month out of the $40 allowed for running expenses.
The results of four months’ experiment were as follows:</p>

<p>The plan for carrying on the dining association using
the Memorial Hall of Harvard University is essentially
one of co-operation, and contains some points that could
be tried with advantage elsewhere. The steward receives
a fixed salary and in addition a small sum each week for
every person who boarded that week at the hall; but
this “head money” is proportionately diminished as the
average weekly price of board exceeds the amount agreed
upon.</p>

<p>At Placid Club, a social club established in the Adirondacks,

but the past season (1896) a dividend of ten per
cent on the wages received was declared out of the profits<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
of the club, and this was given to all house employees
who had remained throughout the season and whose
services had been satisfactory to the manager. The
financial success of the club depended largely on the
efficiency, good-will, and ready co-operation of its employees,
and the dividend declared was in recognition of
this fact.</p>

<p>Beginnings in a small way have been made elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>

<span class="smaller">POSSIBLE REMEDIES—EDUCATION IN HOUSEHOLD AFFAIRS</span></h2>

</div>

<p>One of the greatest obstacles in the way of improving
domestic service has been the prevailing lack of information
in regard to household affairs and of careful, systematic
education of housekeepers.</p>

<p>Information and education are often used as synonymous
terms, but the two words carry with them entirely
different ideas. Information concerning household affairs
includes a ready knowledge of the history of all household
employments and household service, of the economic
basis on which the household rests, and of the economic
principles on which it is conducted. Much of this information
it is now difficult to obtain. Many houses are
found in Southern Germany without windows looking
towards the public highway. Light and air are admitted
through openings in the rear or on a court, but no chance
passer-by is permitted to look within. The household
has always been constructed on the same plan. No outsider
has been permitted to know the percentage of the
family income that goes for service, fuel, gas and water-tax,
groceries, meats, fruits, and vegetables. In the great
majority of households not only is there no disposition
to give others the benefit of such information, but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
information itself does not exist. Each new generation
of housekeepers practically begins its work where the
previous generation began. Its only heritage is recipes
for desserts, rules for making furniture polish, methods
of dealing with moth and mildew, which are handed
down like family property from one generation to another
in a way as primitive as that in which books were preserved
before writing was known. Advance is not thus
made, as is evident from the course followed in other
occupations that have shown greatest progress. A vast
accumulation of knowledge in regard to law has come
through the added experience of individual members of
the profession. It is said that every lawyer owes a debt
of gratitude to his profession which can be paid only by
some personal contribution to the sum total of legal
knowledge. The constant progress made by the profession
of medicine is due to the untiring investigations
carried on by its members, the wide publicity given the
results of these investigations, and the fact that every
discovery made by one member becomes the common
property of all. Until every housekeeper is willing to
recognize her obligations to her profession and to share
with other members the results of her experience, of her
acquired information, and of her personal investigations,
no progress in household affairs can be expected.</p>

<p>Much of the information to be gained in regard to
household affairs is a direct product of education, but
education includes much more. Education gives a certain
amount of information that is of direct service, and
it gives a training that is of indirect but even greater
value. The information more immediately gained comes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
through the study of art, chemistry, economics, physiology,
psychology, and history. The study of art should
enable the housekeeper to build and furnish her home
with taste; of chemistry, to provide for its sanitary construction
and for the proper preparation of all food materials;
of economics, to manage her household on business
principles; of physiology, to study the physical development
of her children; of psychology, to observe their
mental growth and base their training upon it; of history,
to know the progress made in all these departments
of knowledge and avoid repeating as experiments what
others have advanced beyond the experimental stage.
These are the gains on the side of information. The real
work of education in supplying the needs of the household
is far more important. There are constantly arising
in every household emergencies for which the housekeeper
is, and must be, totally unprepared as regards the amount
of available information she possesses. There are demands
made every hour, every moment, for the exercise
of reason, judgment, self-control, alertness, observation,
accuracy, ingenuity, inventive genius, fertility of resources.
The training received by the housekeeper must
be such as to prepare her to meet at any moment any
emergency that may arise within her home. In all ordinary
circumstances she avails herself of the information
gained in school or college and through her general reading,
but this is of no avail in the decision of questions
which arise outside of the field of this information, and
could by no possibility be anticipated by it. If progress
is to be made in the household, it must be no longer
assumed that an establishment can be well managed by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
a young woman whose reasoning powers have never been
cultivated, who has never been taught self-reliance and
self-control, who has no conception of accuracy, who has
never acquired the habit of observation, and whose inventive
genius and fertility of resource are expended in providing
for the pleasures of a day.</p>

<p>No improvement is possible in domestic service until
every part of the household comes abreast of the progress
made outside of the household; until the profession of
housekeeping advances, like the so-called learned professions,
through the accumulated wisdom of its individual
members; until it ceases to be merely a passive recipient
of the progress made elsewhere, and becomes on its own
part an active, creative force.</p>

<p>So much has progress up to this time been hindered
by this inactivity in the household, and so great is the
interdependence of all parts of the household, that it
seems necessary to consider somewhat more in detail the
causes of this condition.</p>

<p>Inactivity in all household affairs has largely come
from three things. It has in the first place been generally
believed that a knowledge of all things pertaining
to the house and home, unlike anything else, comes by
instinct. It is assumed that the housekeeper is born with
an intuitive knowledge of the right proportions of all
materials to be used in cooking—this knowledge sometimes
supplemented by an inherited cook-book and one
purchased to aid a benevolent society soliciting funds for
a charitable purpose. Her knowledge of the mental,
moral, and physical training to be given her children is
also to be gained through instinct and experience and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
traditions handed down with regard to her own family.
Instinct may sometimes be dormant, and experience prove
an expensive schoolmaster through the exaction of heavy
fees, but no other avenue of information has been open
to her. Again, a very large proportion of all moneys
spent for legitimate household purposes passes through
the hands of housekeepers; yet no thorough investigation
on an extensive scale has ever been carried on in
regard to the expenditure made within or for the household.
Few women when they assume the care of a
household know the exact value of the household plant;
the amount to be deducted each year for wear and tear;
the relative proportions expended annually for rent, fuel,
food, clothing, and service; the number of meals served
and the approximate cost of each; the amount of profit,
waste, or unproductiveness that results from all expenditures
made. Every manufacturer, every business man
knows the value of his plant, its increasing or diminishing
value, the cost of materials used and of service
employed. This information constitutes a part of the
intellectual capital with which he begins business; he
does not acquire it by instinct or tradition, but by careful
and exact study of all the factors involved. It is difficult
to see how a household can be successfully carried
on except through the application of the same principles.
If we turn to the construction and decoration of the
house, ignorance, masquerading as instinct, quite as often
prevails. It is true we have houses in which we live,
many of them expensive and artistic, yet as a rule little
or no attention is paid in their construction to the specific
use each of the several parts is to serve. Libraries are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
built with little or no regard to the place to be occupied
in them by book-shelves, desk, or library table, and no
attention is paid to the question of the best methods of
providing them with natural and artificial light. Drawing-rooms
and parlors are built without a place for a
piano, dining-rooms without regard to the position of a
sideboard, butlers’ pantries without an entrance to the
kitchen, kitchens with absolutely no regard to the conveniences
of the work to be carried on there, and bedrooms
with no normal place for a bed, bureau, or dressing-table.
Something has of late been done in deference to public
sentiment towards applying the principles of sanitation
to the construction of public and private buildings, yet
much still remains to be done, both in the investigation
of the principles and in their application. Many of our
private homes are pleasing to the eye, yet if we accept
that definition of art which considers that it is its highest
province to serve best the useful, many of the so-called
artistic homes must be otherwise classed. Before improvement
can be looked for in any of these directions,
the position must be abandoned that the household, or
any single part of it, can be managed by instinct.</p>

<p>A second explanation of the prevailing inactivity in
regard to household affairs arises from the fact that it is
always assumed that these subjects concern only women.
The husband of the family often excuses his absolute
ignorance of the affairs of his own household by the lame
apology, “I leave all these things to my wife and daughters.”
It is certainly not the intention in such remarks
to belittle the affairs of the household, yet that is the
natural and inevitable result. A knowledge of household<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
affairs has never been considered a part of a liberal
education as is a knowledge of literature, science, and
politics, but when it is so regarded by men as well as by
women a great gain will have been made. Moreover, it
must be said that the natural tastes of some men would
lead them to take up housekeeping as an occupation, as
the natural tastes of some women lead them into different
kinds of business. Inactivity in the household will cease
when the arbitrary pressure is removed that now tacitly
compels many women to become housekeepers in violence
to their natural tastes, and at the same time prevents any
man whose abilities lie in this direction from giving them
scope. The time must come when each person will take
up the work in life for which he or she is best adapted,
be it the care of a house for a man or business for a
woman, when it will cease to be a matter of odium for
the husband to direct the affairs of the house and for the
wife to be the breadwinner. When the fact is everywhere
recognized that both men and women have a vital
concern in the affairs of the house, the relation between
the different parts of the household will become an organic
one, and its highest development reached.</p>

<p>A third explanation of this inactivity in the household
is the belief that all women have a natural taste for
household affairs, which without cultivation grows into
positive genius for carrying them on. But a young man
with a genius for law or medicine is not only not expected,
he is not permitted, to exercise his untrained
genius in legal and medical cases. The greater the
genius he gives promise of, the more careful, systematic,
and prolonged is the training he receives. In a similar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
way the woman with a natural taste for housekeeping
duties is the one who should have most training in them,
while in no other way can an interest in such duties be
created in women who have not an inborn love of them.</p>

<p>These three common errors—that a knowledge of
housekeeping affairs is a matter of inspiration, that men
have no active interest in the management of a household,
and that all women have a natural love for such affairs
which supplies the place of training—are perhaps sufficient
explanation of the present lack of all opportunity for
the investigation of the household in a professional way.</p>

<p>It has always been assumed, and asserted without fear
of contradiction, that the best place to learn everything
pertaining to the household is the home. But the same
change must come here as has already come in the profession
of medicine and in nearly every other department
of knowledge. The period is not remote when every
housekeeper made, as well as administered, the family
tonics, bitters, pills, salves, and liniments, and every
household contained a copy of <i>Every Man his Own
Practitioner</i>. Happily that day has passed and the era
of scientific investigation and practice of medicine has
dawned. It was once assumed that an adequate knowledge
of law could be obtained by any young man who
spent six months in reading law in any lawyer’s office.
But the leading members of the bar to-day have been
trained in less haphazard ways. It was formerly believed
that any person could be fitted for a librarian by doing
the routine work of librarian’s assistant in a small country
library. Such training has been supplanted by library
schools open only to college graduates and offering a two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
years’ course of study. Less than a hundred years ago
boys and girls of sixteen or seventeen years of age began
teaching without even a high school education, while the
tendency to-day is everywhere to insist not only on advanced
academic but also on professional training. The
system of apprenticeship is everywhere being supplanted
by systematic, technical training given by experts.</p>

<p>There is evidence that this same spirit is slowly invading
the household. Cooking schools are springing up
that teach all the intricacies of the science “in ten easy
lessons,” while the lecturer on cooking with her demonstration
lessons has found her way into nearly every
town. Sewing is taught in the public schools, and the free
kitchen garden is following fast in the train of the free
kindergarten. All this is good in its way, but it is superficial
work. No permanent advance will be made as long
as only those schools are found that teach simply the
mechanical parts of housekeeping. New recipes for
salads and puddings, new ways of cleaning brass and
silver, new methods of caring for hard-wood floors—all
these may be helpful in a sense, but the knowledge of
these and a thousand other mechanical contrivances will
never put the household on a scientific basis and turn its
face towards progress.</p>

<p>One thing, and only one thing, will turn the household
into the channels where every other occupation has made
advancement. This is the establishment of a great professional
school, amply equipped for the investigation of
all matters pertaining to the household and <i>open only to
graduates of the leading colleges and universities of the
country</i>. This work cannot and should not be done by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
the college. The college offers courses in physiology and
hygiene, but the college graduate is permitted to practice
medicine only after a long and thorough course in a medical
school. The college offers courses in constitutional
law, but the college student is admitted to the bar only
after technical training in the law school. The college
offers courses in chemistry and economics, but the college
student who expects to have the care of a home
should prepare herself for this work by technical study of
all that concerns the household. The mechanical parts of
housekeeping can be learned in the home, providing the
head of the household herself understands the intricacies
of the mechanism over which she has charge, and has the
gift of imparting knowledge. These assumptions, however,
cannot always be made, nor can it be assumed that
even all the mechanical parts of housekeeping can be
learned in any single home any more than that all forms
of library work can be learned from a single library.
Some of these mechanical parts of housekeeping can be
learned in the kitchen-garden, the public school, the cooking
school, but progress is never made by treadmill methods,
by mechanical repetition, by giving attention only to those
things already known. Professional training and investigation
must supplement home and collegiate instruction
in the case of the housekeeper, as the professional school
supplements private and collegiate instruction for the
physician, the lawyer, and the clergyman.</p>

<p>The household has been up to this time a <i>terra incognita</i>.
Until but yesterday absolutely nothing had been
done in any educational institution towards investigating
its past history, its present condition, its future needs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
The beginning has scarcely been made, although the field
for such investigation is limitless. Comparatively little
is known of artistic house-building and furnishing,
scarcely more of household sanitation<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> and the chemistry
of foods,<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> even less of the economic principles underlying
the household; fashion, not art, governs every question
of costume, while, with a few notable exceptions, Porter’s
<i>Development of the Human Intellect</i> contains the sum and
substance of our knowledge of the mental development of
children. Years of patient, laborious, unremitting investigation
must be given to all household affairs before any
appreciable advance can be made by them. The historical
and scientific investigation of all the great subjects of
art, economics, chemistry, physiology, and psychology in
their application to the household, and the publication of
the results of these investigations, would not indeed settle
to-morrow all the difficulties that arise to-day in regard
to household affairs; but such investigation and publication
would take the subject out of the domain of sentiment
and transfer it to a realm where reason and
judgment have the control. Household affairs would in
time come to receive the respect now accorded the learned
professions. Household service, instead of being taken up
as a last resort by those who themselves say “have not
education enough to do anything else,” would be dignified
into a profession that would attract large numbers
who now seek other occupations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span></p>

<p>It has already been said that “educational forces do
not push from the bottom, they pull from the top.”
When a strong educational force exerted from the top
shall have pulled the household and all questions connected
with it out of the slough of stagnation in which it
has been for so long a time, then, and not till then, will
training schools for domestic employees be successful.
Progress in every other field of human activity has been
made only through investigation and the widespread diffusion
of the results of such investigation; on similar
investigations rests the only hope of making progress in
household affairs.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br>
<span class="smaller">CONCLUSION</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Any study of the subject of domestic service must
lead to the conclusion that household service and household
employments do not occupy an isolated position;
that while they may be indifferent to the political, industrial,
and social changes constantly occurring, they
cannot by virtue of this indifference remain unaffected
by them; that the inventions of the past hundred
years have revolutionized household employments, and
that the present generation must adapt itself to these
new conditions; that while a century ago domestic
service had no competitors as an occupation for women,
it now has hundreds; that the personnel in the domestic
service of America has been transformed through
industrial, political, and social revolutions; that it has
been affected by the democratic tendencies of the age
and by the commercial and educational development of
the country; that because of these constantly recurring
changes in the conditions surrounding domestic service
the questions connected with it vary from year to year;
that it is governed by the same general economic laws
as are all other employments, and that it has developed
within itself other economic laws peculiar to it; that
the increasing wealth and luxury of the country are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
introducing new complications into a problem already
far from simple; that both employer and employee are
heirs of conditions which their ancestors could not control,
and that they are surrounded by difficulties which
no person single-handed and alone can hope successfully
to overcome.</p>

<p>It has been seen that many of these difficulties arise
from the failure to recognize domestic service as a part
of the great industrial questions of the day. It is not
so recognized because economic writers have not as yet
discussed the subject, and because those who come in
daily contact with it overlook its economic side. The
housekeeper who completes her round of morning shopping
by a visit to an employment bureau where she
engages a new cook regards that and her other business
transactions all in the same light; she has both in
shopping and in securing a cook been guided solely by
her taste, her necessities, and her bank account. The
economist must include domestic service in his discussions
of the labor question, and the housekeeper must
differentiate the various parts of her housekeeping duties
before improvement is possible.</p>

<p>It must also be recognized that another difficulty has
been the natural conservatism of many women—a conservatism
arising from the isolated, home-centred lives
many housekeepers lead, and that prevents that intellectual
hospitality which is the presager of all true
progress. The typical housekeeper, like the Turk, is
a born fatalist; because things are as they are, they
must always have been so and they must continue so
to be. Many persons take pride in being “old-time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
housekeepers” and look with disfavor on any change.
“That plan might succeed in some families, but it would
not in mine” is for many others the final settlement of
the question. This lack of mental elasticity and the
dislike of taking the initiative in any movement must be
another obstacle in the way of immediate improvement.</p>

<p>It has also been seen that other causes partially explain
the difficulty—the love of ease and pleasure, the attempt
to keep up appearances, a pretentious manner of living,
the frequent desire of both employers and employees to
get everything for nothing, the willingness of mistresses
to find maids who will do their work half right and of
maids to find mistresses who will treat them half right,
the endeavor to get “the largest expenditure of woman
for the smallest expenditure of money,” a natural tendency
among women toward aristocracy and a dislike of
everything savoring of social democracy.</p>

<p>Some of the difficulty arises from conditions to be expected
in a country comparatively new and possessing
great possibilities of wealth. The growing luxury among
the middle classes not only creates a demand for more
employees but it also increases the requisitions upon
those rendering service. Those who have lately acquired
riches make increasing demands upon their employees,
and they must become accustomed to their
riches before these demands will be modified. Bishop
Potter has said, “Luxury has its decent limits, and we
in this land are in danger in many directions of overstepping
those limits.”<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> Persons with moderate means
are the greatest sufferers from this thoughtless transgression<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
of the bounds of luxury. The remedy lies in
such education of the wealthy classes, especially where
wealth has been suddenly acquired, as will give a more
practical knowledge of general and household economics,
a realization of the ethical as well as of the economic
principle involved in paying high wages for poor service
and abnormally high wages for good service, such
an education as will result in greater simplicity in manner
of living because it will be governed by ethical,
economic, and hygienic principles.</p>

<p>It is true that in thousands of households no difficulty
in regard to domestic service exists, but this fact does not
relieve those in charge of such households from further
responsibility in the matter. A political club recently
formed to secure better municipal government in Montreal
took as its watchword, “Every man is individually
responsible for just so much evil as his efforts might
prevent.”<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> In a similar way the responsibility of the
employer does not end with his own household, but he
is responsible for as much evil in the general condition
of domestic service as he could have prevented by his
investigation and discussion of the subject.</p>

<p>The first result of this investigation, discussion, and
action must be the attempt to remove from domestic
service the social stigma attached to it. During the
feudal period every occupation was inferior socially to
that of warfare; physicians were leeches, clergymen were
held in disrepute, bankers were usurers, and merchants
and traders were tolerated only because they could furnish
the ready money necessary for military campaigns—social<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
position belonged only to the profession of arms.
The substitution of higher ideals for those of feudalism
and the spread of democratic ideas have removed the
social ban from every occupation except domestic service.
Industrial and social evolution point to its ultimate
removal from this employment as has been the
case in others.</p>

<p>A second result of investigation and discussion must
be the working out of ways and means for taking both
work and worker out of the house of the employer.
This must result in a simplification of household management
and a greater flexibility in household employments.
It simplifies the household because it takes out of it a
cumbersome, unwieldy machine long since become antiquated.
It is possible to arrange a series of mechanical
contrivances operated by electricity that will enable a
person to open any window or door in his house without
rising from his chair, but it is as a rule easier to open
a window without such assistance than it is to keep the
batteries in running order. A retinue of employees in
a household becomes like a complicated mechanism used
to attain simple ends. Taking the employee out of the
house of the employer brings flexibility into household
employments, since it results in greater personal independence
and in openings for specialized work. An
ambitious and energetic office boy is pushed on by his
employer into more responsible positions, but the domestic
employee is held back by impassable barriers. Industrial
promotion is impossible as the occupation at present
exists. “I suppose there must be a screw loose somewhere,
or a man of his age would not be my coachman,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
said a lawyer recently in reply to a question concerning
a new employee. The industrial barriers within the
occupation must be removed before domestic service will
attract large numbers of capable, efficient persons; this
can be at least partially accomplished by taking the employee
out of the house and allowing him or her to become
a self-reliant, independent, business person.</p>

<p>Another direction in which progress lies is in the effort
to put the employment on a business basis. This must
be accomplished if any improvement is to come. No man
takes his watch to a blacksmith to be repaired, or employs
a mason as bookkeeper, or a longshoreman as superintendent
of a mill, or a hod-carrier as floor-walker, yet practically
the same thing is done when a housekeeper employs
an inexperienced young woman as seamstress, installs a
girl just from Ireland as cook, takes a tenement-house
woman into her home to care for her table linen and bric-à-brac,
and then adds to the incongruity of the situation
by paying high wages for this unskilled labor. Some
agreement must be reached by employers in regard to
standards of work and wages before domestic service can
be classed as skilled labor.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p>The suggestion of profit sharing is in line with the
effort to put the occupation on a business basis. Only
where there is absolute equality, when employer and
employee stand on the same business level, can amiability
of manner and a spirit of helpfulness on the part
of the employee be prevented from being interpreted as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
springing from a desire to curry favor with the employer.
Not until the domestic employee feels he has no reason
to court the favor of his employer for the sake of possible
perquisites will he be self-respecting, and therefore
entitled to respect from others. The practice in many
private houses of subsidizing employees by numerous and
valuable gifts is as subversive of the best interests of all
concerned, as is the giving of fees in large establishments.
It fosters subserviency rather than responsibility,
and creates dissatisfaction among the employees
in families where the custom does not and perhaps cannot
prevail. Profit sharing appeals not to selfishness but
to intelligence, and has in it elements that tend to make
the employee a self-respecting and therefore a better man.</p>

<p>Improvement in all these directions, or in other ways
far better, can come only through the investigation of all
household affairs by both men and women. Travellers
in other countries often lament the sight, still so common
in some places, of a woman harnessed to a cart with a
dog, or dragging the cart by her own efforts, or weighed
down by the heavy burdens placed upon her back. But
a more unfortunate condition in such countries than the
woman harnessed to a cart is the fact that wherever this
is found the highest opportunities for education are not
open to women. The woman and the cart will remain in
every country where university education is not made
possible for her. Until university investigation of domestic
affairs is made possible for every one having the
proper qualifications, the woman and the cart—the overburdened,
ignorant, and hopeless worker—will remain
in the household.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span></p>

<p>If progress is to be made in the same direction that
it has been up to this time, it must bring a still further
readjustment of the work of both men and women. It
must result in attracting every man and woman to the
work for which he or she is best fitted. Just as other
forms of work once held in low estimation have been
elevated by scientific advancement, so the time will come
when it will be honorable to do housework of any kind
for remuneration. A woman with no talent for art has
been known after four lessons in oil painting to offer for
sale the products of her work without blushing for her
audacity or incompetence. But though ignorant of art,
she may have been competent in cooking, and if the way
had been open to gain an honorable support by the exercise
of this talent, she might have been saved the attempt
to secure a living by means from which nothing but failure
ought to result. The mistress of a large and costly
establishment said recently, “One of the most difficult
things about housekeeping is to dispose of old fancy
work.” Much of this work represents idle labor in
boarding houses, done by women in various walks of life
who will not keep house under present conditions, but
who would be glad to do so if the conditions could be
made more favorable.</p>

<p>It is in many ways difficult to deal with woman as an
economic factor, since many elements of uncertainty enter
into her life which do not hamper men. A young man
is reasonably sure of two things in his future life,—that
he will have to support himself and that he will marry.
But many young women are not certain of either marriage
or the necessity of self-support. If a young woman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
marries, she is not permitted by the conventions of society
to be a breadwinner; on the other hand, she may
she may obliged, without preparation for it, to provide
support, not only for herself but also for her family. If
she marries and boards, she probably finds herself obliged
to become a drone, and leads an aimless life. If, without
deference to convention, she engages in business, her
occupation may be broken up through the removal of
her husband’s business to another locality. For economic
reasons it is impracticable for the married woman to engage
in any industry involving the use of capital that
cannot be readily transferred, unless this business is the
same as that of her husband, or unless she bears the
entire burden of support and has unrestricted control
of the business enterprises of the family. A thorough
knowledge of some one line of domestic work which
would yield compensation would often lessen many of
the perplexities surrounding a married woman. Moreover,
it seems not unreasonable to consider marriage on
its practical side as a business partnership to which the
woman as well as the man is to contribute. If she contributes
a practical knowledge of housekeeping, the business
agreement is a fair one; if she does not contribute
this knowledge, but brings a knowledge of other things
as valuable, it is also a fair arrangement; but if she
brings no knowledge of household affairs, and no equivalent
for it, the partnership on its business side is unfair.
There should be a definite understanding when a woman
marries whether she is to keep house or not, and if so,
that she knows how. The time ought to come when, in
case she marries and boards, she will be willing and able,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
and society will allow her, to contribute her share in a
business capacity to the life partnership.</p>

<p>Thousands of ambitious and talented women in the
upper and middle classes are crying for work, as women
in a lower walk cry for bread. It is impossible for society
to maintain the former in idleness and at the same time
to pay full wages for work to the army of working
women. The pay of wage-earning women will never rise
above the starvation point while the women of the upper
and middle classes are permitted to live without work.
The boycotting of dealers in ready-made clothing whose
names are not on the “white list” is but a sop thrown to
Cerberus,—until the cause of the evil is removed, until
women now living in idleness become co-operators in the
work of the world, all women who work for remuneration
must do their share of the work for half-pay. Women
want work for all the reasons that men want it, but as
long as so many of them, when they do work, persistently
give their work for nothing, just so long will women’s
work in general be undervalued.</p>

<p>This readjustment of work and the willingness of
larger numbers of women to work for remuneration would
be as productive of improvement in all household affairs
as division of labor has been elsewhere. A more far-reaching
benefit is suggested by Maria Mitchell when she
says: “The dressmaker should no more be a universal
character than the carpenter. Suppose every man should
feel it his duty to do his own mechanical work and <i>all</i>
kinds, would society be benefited? would the work be
well done? Yet a woman is expected to know how to do
all kinds of sewing, all kinds of cooking, all kinds of any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
<i>woman’s</i> work, and the consequence is that life is passed
in learning these only, while the universe of truth beyond
remains unentered.”<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>In seeking for some measure of relief from the present
oppressive conditions, it must be said in conclusion that
little can be accomplished except through the use of
means which already exist, developing these along lines
marked out by industrial progress in other fields. In the
foregoing suggestions,—that the historical study of the
subject points to relief through the removal of the social
stigma; that the specialization of household employments
in consequence of the removal of as much work as possible
and the removal of the domestic employee as well
from the home of the employer leads to a simpler and
better manner of life for both employer and employee;
that the introduction of profit sharing is one means of placing
household employments on a business basis; that the
establishment in connection with one of our great universities
of a school of investigation open only to graduates
of the leading reputable colleges is the only opportunity
for the scientific advancement of the household and all
questions connected with it; and that together with the
last, a recognition of the necessity for the readjustment
of the work of both men and women must result in making
any form of housework for remuneration honorable
for any person, man or woman,—in these suggestions
nothing either novel or original has been presented.
Progress has been made through such means; it seems
not unreasonable to believe that further progress will be
made through their use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span></p>

<p>Yet this view of the subject does not diminish, it rather
increases, individual responsibility. Sir James Stephen
said, when civil-service reform was first agitated in
England, that a moral revolution was necessary in that
country before the reform sought could become an accomplished
fact. For a reform in domestic service a
moral revolution is everywhere needed, bringing with it
to every person an appreciation of his responsibility to all
connected with the employment, whether employer or
employee.</p>

<p>Reforms begin at the top, revolutions at the bottom.
It rests with the men and women of the so-called upper
classes, whether raised to their position by birth, wealth,
intellect, education, or opportunity, to work out in the
best way a satisfactory solution of the vexed question of
domestic service.</p>

<span class="smaller">DOMESTIC SERVICE IN EUROPE</span></h2>

</div>

<p>It is apparently a common belief in America that there
are no difficulties in domestic service in Europe, as it is
an equally common belief in Europe that the difficulties
in domestic service are greater in America than in any
other country.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> The judgment in one case is as extreme
as it is in the other. It is indeed as unsafe to make a
generalization in regard to all the phases of domestic
service in Europe as it is to make similar generalizations
concerning all sections of America—different countries
have their own peculiar problems to meet, and these vary
in details as do the problems in different sections of
America. Yet a careful examination of the question may
lead to the conclusion that the differences in the condition
of domestic service in Europe and in America are
those of degree rather than those of fundamental principles;
that the situation in Europe is modified rather than
radically altered by the social and political conditions
existing there; that as these conditions in Europe and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
in America become more alike even these external differences
will disappear, and that an ideal form of domestic
service exists as yet only in the castles of Spain.</p>

<p>Any consideration of domestic service as it is found
in Europe to-day must frankly recognize at the outset
that the social and political conditions that affect the
question result on the one hand from tradition and
long-established customs, and on the other from the social
and political unrest that was born of the French Revolution.
The past and the present, the present and the
future, stability and unrest, blind obedience and personal
freedom, aristocracy and democracy, have been and are
perpetually at war with each other. Every political
revolution that has widened the circle of democracy,
every industrial movement that has affected large classes
of workers, every modification of national ideals of education,
every social change that has shifted the relations of
classes to each other, every barrier between nations that
has been broken down or that has been put up, has
changed the problem of domestic service. In England
the tendencies towards social aristocracy on the one hand
and political democracy on the other, in Germany the
trend towards the exaction of military obedience in every
walk in life and the counter influences of the social
democratic party, in France the deadening hand of
bureaucracy and the opposing unrestrained passions of
the multitude, in Italy the inherited prejudice against
manual labor and the necessity of gaining a livelihood by
means of it,—all these forces so diametrically opposed
to each other, and so inevitably coming into collision,
are but illustrations of conflicting forces that have entered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
and that must enter into the question. Political, industrial,
educational, and social changes have made England
a manufacturing nation, have made Germany one denominated
by a military spirit and a military régime, have
made Italy a land given over to petty industries, and
have emphasized in France the tendency to seek official
positions, no matter how small the salary involved, rather
than embark on individual enterprises involving initiative.
Some changes that have come within scarcely
more than a hundred years have been peculiar to a single
country, most of them have been shared by all, while not
a few have affected America as well as Europe. The
changes have often been wrought silently, but they have
been none the less effective because they have come
unnoticed and unrecognized alike by the employer and
by the employed in domestic service.</p>

<p>On the other hand, domestic service is affected by
many external conditions that are apparent to the most
casual observer. These often vary in the different countries,
and often explain in turn some of the conditions
that differentiate domestic service in one European country
from that in another, as well as domestic service in
Europe as a whole from that in America. One illustration
is found in the varying types of domestic architecture
which grow out of the varying national ideals of
home and of social life. The typical English dwelling,
whether it is detached, semi-detached, or one of a series,
is complete in itself and cut off from all communication
with its neighbors. The huge French apartment house
containing half a dozen or a dozen families, without an
elevator and dominated by its concierge, has an artery<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
in a common stairway leading from the <i>loge</i> of the concierge
to the upper floor occupied by all of the domestics
in the building. The small apartment house or detached
house of the German is isolated, but it is in close proximity
to a garden café. The lofty, cheerless, mediæval
palace in which the Italian finds his abode is typical of
the hardness of life for those serving and those served.
These fundamental differences in the material construction
of buildings must have an influence on the question
of domestic service. Houses arranged perpendicularly as
in England, or horizontally as in France and Germany,
or located in the air as in Italy, carry with them their own
peculiarities of service and of work. Countries where ice
is not freely used, and apartment houses without places for
storage, make inevitable the daily marketing and purchasing
all supplies in small quantities; the delicatessen shop
and the garden café simplify the question of the evening
meal in Germany; the elimination of breakfast from the
daily meals everywhere on the continent reduces to a
minimum that problem in domestic service. The isolation
of life in one country, the simplicity of life in
another, the entire absence of hospitality in still another,
all affect the question, sometimes rendering it more simple,
sometimes more complex than in America.</p>

<p>Yet when everything has been said, the fact remains
that in all essentials the state of domestic service is the
same in Europe as in America. Employers on both sides
of the Atlantic meet with the same serious difficulties in
their efforts to secure competent household employees,
and these difficulties find their explanation in precisely the
same conditions. They have already been enumerated in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
the case of the American employer,<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> and the list tallies in
every particular with the enumeration of those met by
the employer in Europe. It is hard to secure the services
of women in the household because they prefer work in
factories where the hours of work are definitely prescribed
and evenings and Sundays are free; because they prefer
work in shops where their individual life is less under
control than it is in the household of an employer; because
they prefer service in hotels and in large pensions
since these give opportunity for specialized work, a life of
variety and excitement, and larger wages in the form of
fees; because they prefer short engagements with large
fees at summer resorts to permanent engagements with
moderate wages in families; because the growing spirit
of democracy rebels against the inferior social position
accorded household employees, even to those whose work
is rightly classed as skilled labor. Obtaining help is difficult
in small villages because employees prefer the excitement
of city life; on the other hand, employers in large
cities must meet the competition of shops and factories.</p>

<p>In every country, it is true, there are districts where
something of the old patriarchal relationship between
master and servant still exists, where service in a household
descends from parent to child, where democratic
ideas have not penetrated, where, be it said, the railway,
the telegraph, and the automobile are as yet unknown.
In such districts the question of household service is a
simple one. But each year, as these classes become more
and more affected by new social and industrial conditions,
the perplexities in domestic service increase. Moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
it must be remembered that every period and every country
has its legend of an antecedent time and of a mythical
Utopia where ideal service for every one has always
been found. These legends concerning service in Europe
are entitled to no more credence than are similar legends
in America—the time and the place where difficulties in
domestic service are not and have not been known are as
vanishing points of the compass.</p>

<p>There are, however, certain variations of the problem
in Europe and these must be considered.</p>

<p>The European employer of domestic labor is at a distinct
advantage in comparison with the employer of such
labor in America in that little or no baking is done in the
individual household, and washing as a rule is done out
of the house,<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> or if done in it, is often made a serious
matter like the semi-annual housecleaning,<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> while the continental
breakfast of coffee and rolls practically reduces
the first meal of the day to a negative quantity.</p>

<p>It is indeed an open question whether the simplification
of household work thus secured is not more than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
counterbalanced by the lack of modern conveniences for
doing housework, by the absence of any system of uniform
heating and the consequent necessity of carrying fuel
to every room that is to be warmed, by the absence of
elevators and the hard work thereby entailed on employer
and employee alike, and by the necessity apparently
encumbent on every member of many households of
crocheting endless yards of trimming, working on canvas,
and storing away for future use countless piles of
household linen. But these are at least variations from
our own problem, and both employer and employee in
Europe have certain advantages in their work even if
these are counterbalanced by corresponding disadvantages.</p>

<p>The employer in Europe, especially in Germany, is at
an advantage in being able, indeed often compelled by
law, to make a contract specifying the term of service
for which the employee is engaged. In Germany<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> contracts
are usually made in the city by the quarter, in
the country by the year. If the contract is made by the
quarter, notice of a change on either side must be given
six weeks in advance; if made by the year, three months’
notice must be given; where the contract is made for only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
a month, notice must be given fourteen days in advance;
in all cases notice must be given before twelve o’clock at
noon.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> If an employee is dismissed without due notice
before the expiration of the contract, the employer must
pay wages and board for the remainder of the time.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> If
an employee leaves without giving the legal notice, he
can be brought back by the police and be also subject
to fine and imprisonment.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> Again, it is impossible for
a person to engage a servant while in the employ of
another without the knowledge and consent of the latter,
while any one who entices a servant away from his place
is subject to fine and imprisonment.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<p>It must be said, however, that there is another side to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
the contract. If it protects the employer in reducing
to a minimum the chances of his being left without a
servant, it also makes his life a burden during the long
period that intervenes between the notice and the time
when it takes effect. The service given by a servant
during this time becomes absolutely perfunctory, while
the personal relations become so strained as to render the
situation almost intolerable. The temptation besets the
housekeeper to “rather bear those ills she has than fly
to others that she knows not of,” and thus she often encourages
poor work by tolerating it, because she is unwilling
to give the necessary notice, endure the still poorer
service after it has been given, and in the end incur the
risk of getting another servant no more efficient than her
predecessor.</p>

<p>Yet undoubtedly this extreme form of government
supervision in Germany is successful there. The police
officials administer many a wholesome rebuke to both
parties to the contract. If an employer is in the habit
of changing servants often, that fact is known to the
police through the service books and the notifications of
change that every employer must make. When, therefore,
such an one complains to the police that his servant
is impertinent or remiss in some way where he wishes
legal redress, the officer will probably advise him not to
make the attempt. “You had better not say anything
about this, every one knows that you cannot keep a servant
long.”<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> If an employee makes too frequent complaint
of ill usage at the hands of his employer, he will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
probably be dismissed with a reprimand for his own
shortcomings.</p>

<p>One form of government supervision that has been
specially commended in other countries is the German
service book. This represents the most complete safeguard
that has been devised to protect employers from
imposition on the one hand and, on the other, to assist
employees in securing places. Every person before going
into domestic service must obtain from the police one
of these books. A blank page is filled out by the police,
giving a description of the person about to enter service.
When the first engagement is made, the name of the
employer and the date of beginning service are entered
in the book and it receives the official stamp. When an
employee leaves a place, the date with the reason for leaving
and a statement in regard to the character and efficiency
of the servant must be entered in the book by the
employer and the book then returned to the police. No
domestic employee can secure a position in Germany
without one of these service books—it is a passport
that must be viséd by the government officials and previous
employers before he can enter or leave a position,
and no passport regulations in any country are more
stringent than are these service-book requirements in
Germany. It would seem, therefore, that this public
statement concerning an employee and the official recognition
of it by the police authorities ought to be an unimpeachable
recommendation. That this is not the case,
however, seems to be the all but universal testimony.
The service book is of value in weeding out inefficient
employees, whose inefficiency, however, would often be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
self-evident without the aid of a service book. It is not
only true that in this, as in every other form of recommendation,
the mistress is anxious to say the best thing
possible for a maid to help her in securing another place,
but the law compels an employer to go still farther and
to say nothing that will prevent an employee from finding
employment. If an employer suspects the honesty
of an employee, he is not free to state that suspicion in
the service book; if he has positive proof of his dishonesty,
he must enter legal complaint against the
employee; if he has no such evidence, he must not even
hint at his suspicions. Moreover, the law goes yet one
step farther and compels every employer to believe an
employee innocent in every respect until he is proved
guilty. Not only is he not free to say that he suspects the
honesty of an employee, or to leave out the word “honest,”
but he must state positively that the employee <i>is</i> honest.<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>
This policy is justified on the ground that it is a necessary
protection to the weaker class, but it of necessity
impairs the absolute reliability of the testimonials given,
and it lessens materially the value of the service book as
far as it concerns the employer. Even in Germany with
the aid of the strong arm of the law it seems as impossible
as it is in other countries to devise any system of recommendations
that will tell the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, and that will at the same time
satisfy the desire of an employer to secure a place for an
employee he can himself no longer tolerate and also the
claims of an employee to the right to turn a fresh page<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
and try once more to give satisfaction to a new employer.
The recommendations of the previous employers of
would-be employees must be discounted in Germany as
well as in America.</p>

<p>This government regulation of domestic service in Germany
is acquiesced in because government regulation
extends to other industries and because obedience is
man’s first law throughout the empire. In so far as the
conditions can be reached by law this regulation seems to
be successful. But there are many factors in the problem
that cannot be so reached,—infirmities of temper, the visiting
soldier, the preference for an easy place, the desire
for city life. Here the German housekeeper must depend
on her own resources, and her problem is the same as that
in every other country.</p>

<p>Another advantage domestic service in Europe has over
service in America lies in the large number of men engaged
in the employment.<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> The reasons for this are not
indeed perhaps directly apparent. But domestic service
as an occupation for men must command a higher
respect in Europe than in America for two reasons:
first, the competition with those belonging to a foreign,
or to a so-called inferior race is reduced to a minimum.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
Household service is performed in France by Frenchmen,
in Italy by Italians, and in Germany by Germans. In
England it is given in part by Englishmen, but also to a
great extent by foreigners, and the invasion of the occupation
by those not English by birth may be one explanation
why the occupation is falling into ill repute among
native-born Englishmen. That the service is better performed
by the foreigner than it is by the Englishman
explains why employers seek the services of the former
rather than those of the latter,<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> and perhaps incidentally
why the native-born servant so readily leaves the field
to his rival.</p>

<p>Another explanation why domestic service as an occupation
for men commands a higher respect in Europe lies
in the relatively higher qualifications that men must have.
Not only must a man in domestic service have the same
qualifications as would be demanded of him in the same
occupation here, but he must be able to speak from one to
half a dozen languages in addition to his own.<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> Domestic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
service is for men an occupation, and they make preparation
for it as for any other technical trade. They must
spend from one to two years in other countries learning
the language<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> in order to increase their market value;
the position they can command and the wages they can
earn depend, other things being equal, on the amount of
capital they have invested in themselves. The social
restrictions placed on women prevent their going from
one country to another in a similar way, and thus men,
for this and other reasons, command everywhere the best
places, and they probably occupy a relatively higher social
position than do men in the same occupation in America.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of the employer one advantage
domestic service in Europe has, is that it apparently
costs less than it does in America. The money wages
paid domestic employees are nominally much lower than
in America, apparently ranging from about three dollars
a month for an ordinary housemaid to eight dollars a
month for an excellent cook,<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> in addition to board and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
lodging.<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> But these wages are supplemented in a score
of ways. A present in money of from five to eight dollars
is often given at Christmas or New Year’s, another
is given at Easter, and a third on birthdays,<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> while at all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
times the temper of the cook must be propitiated with
gifts of clothing and the housemaid remembered in a similar
way.<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> Not only are members of the family expected
to make these additions to the nominal wages given, but
guests and transient visitors pay similar tribute.<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> Moreover,
the butcher, the baker, and the candlestickmaker all
increase the monthly stipend of servants by frequent fees
given in return for trade secured through them,<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
no inconsiderable part of the wages received—or taken—comes
in the form of profits,<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> perquisites and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
“gratifications.”<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> Still another factor must be added, the daily
allowance for wine or beer, or its money equivalent.<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>
In France, according to Weber, men-servants are paid
while performing military service,—“it is an act of patriotism
and of social solidarity.”<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> In Germany girls in
the country sometimes receive part of their wages in the
use granted of a small piece of land where they can raise
flax. This they spin, weave, and sell, adding thus something
to their wages. Compulsory insurance in Germany
and in Belgium materially increases the cash wages
paid by the employer.<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> It is thus extremely difficult to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
state with even approximate exactness the amount of
wages received by domestics in Europe, since the total
amount is affected to such an extent by the variable factors
of fees and outside perquisites.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> It is still more
difficult to compute the variations that wages have undergone
from a past to the present time.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span></p>

<p>That the cost of domestic service is in many places in
excess of what it should be is indicated by the growing
custom among certain classes of employers of demanding
as their right a percentage of the fees received,<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> and the
protests, as yet unavailing, on the part of the public
against the exactions of these fees by either employer or
employee.<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> It seems not unreasonable to conclude, in
view of all the various ways by which wages are augmented,
that they are in reality much greater than their
face value indicates, and in many parts of the service
greatly in advance of wages in other corresponding occupations.</p>

<p>The question naturally arises whether the value of the
service rendered is commensurate with its cost, but it is
a question that must remain unanswered in default of
any common standard by which service can be gauged.<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
Figaro has answered the question theoretically in the
other question put to Count Almaviva, “Measured by the
virtues demanded of a servant, does your excellency know
many masters worthy of being valets?”<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<p>But the wage received sums up as little in Europe as
it does in America the subject of domestic service. Even
good wages do not altogether compensate for long hours
of service,<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> hardness of work<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>
    and of life,<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> and entire lack
of social intercourse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span></p>

<p>It is undeniable that the social conditions that surround
domestic servants in Europe are harder than in America.
They are the survivals of the condition of serfdom, as
this was in turn the survival of a preëxisting state of
slavery.<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> Literature everywhere testifies to the social
chasm that has at all times existed between master and
slave, master and servant, mistress and maid, and employer
and employee, as it also does to the manifold
imperfections of both parties to the domestic contract,<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
while on the stage as well as in the daily press it has been
the domestic servant who has always been made the butt
of jest and ridicule.<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> “Now, as before and during the
Revolution,” says M. Salomon, tersely, “it (the occupation)
remains under the ban of society; customs are not
changed with laws.”<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> It is true that the domestic servant
is often apparently unconscious of the existence
of this social ban, and that even when he is conscious of
it, he acquiesces in it and accepts it as a part of the social
order that he cannot and perhaps would not change, yet
this unconsciousness of it does not alter the fact of its
existence.</p>

<p>The social disadvantages of domestic service show
themselves under the same guise as in America, though
often in a much more exaggerated form. In England
the existence of a tax on men-servants puts at once a
social chasm between the master who pays a tax on luxuries
and the servant who is an outward manifestation of
that luxury, while the servility of manner that an American
finds so exasperating in an English servant is encouraged
and even demanded as the birthright inheritance
of a well-born Englishman.<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> The servants in their turn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
enforce among themselves similar social distinctions and
the recognition by their fellows of the various grades of
social superiority or inferiority<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>—a condition that has
its origin partly in a desire to imitate the customs and
manners of those above them in the social scale,<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> and
partly in the extreme specialization of every form of
household work and the resulting inflexibility of all
parts of it.<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> It follows that in England “domestic service
provides no general bond—perhaps, indeed, rather
accentuates class indifferences,” and that, as an occupation,
for this and other reasons, “domestic service,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
though lucrative and in many ways luxurious, is not
popular.”<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<p>In France, while the relations between employer and
employee are much more democratic than in England,
the social stigma is put on the household servant, in
part because of the traditional character given servants
in French literature, in part because the construction of
the French apartment house places the rooms of all the
servants in the mansard story and thus draws a line of
social demarkation between those served and those serving,
in part because of the bureaucratic character of
society.</p>

<p>In Italy, domestic servants have apparently no social life
whatever. This is partially explained by the long hours
of work that leave them no opportunity for it; it is in
part because women servants never go out in the evening,
receive no callers, and are, as it is often explained, “really
servants,” in the sense of having no social ambitions;
and it is also because manual work in every form is considered
degrading, and those who engage in it are under
the social ban—a condition that is apparently accepted
without outward protest.</p>

<p>Yet much is done to mitigate some of the hard features
in the lot of the domestic servant. One of the interesting
features in the condition of domestic service in Germany<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
is the large number of benefactions organized for
the benefit of domestic employees. There are everywhere
homes for aged servants,<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> homes for servants out of
work,<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>
    unions for providing servants with recreation,<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
and schools and homes where they are taught household
employments.<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<p>Yet when all has been said the fact remains that even
in Germany the lot of a household employee is a hard
one. “Servants hate a dull place worse than a hard
one,” and when a place is both dull and hard it has
indeed little to commend it. Women in Europe as in
America enter domestic service by the line of least resistance,
and this explains why in both countries so many
are found in the occupation and why so many of these
are incompetent in their work and unhappy in their lives.</p>

<p>In one important respect the condition of domestic service
in Europe is immeasurably behind that in America.
Even more than here domestic service and domestic servants
are the targets at which are aimed the satire and
the ridicule of literature and the press, and this is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
counterbalanced by earnest study of the subject as is the
case with us. The question is everywhere discussed in
America, not because the difficulties here are greater than
they are elsewhere, but because it is coming to be recognized
as a part of the great labor problem of the day.
If the future holds for us a solution of the problem, it is
because we believe it is worthy of historical study and
of scientific investigation, and in giving it this recognition
we have put it on a higher plane than the one
it as yet occupies in Europe.<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> The total number of domestic servants is given as 1,454,791. This
does not include launderers and laundresses, paid housekeepers in private
families and hotels, or stewards and stewardesses. It excludes also the
very large number of persons performing the same duties as domestic
servants, but without receiving a fixed compensation.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> This estimate is based on the supposition that the average wages paid
are $3.00 per week, and that two weeks’ vacation is given with loss of
wages. Both of these are probably underestimates, as will be seen farther
on. If the wages paid launderers and laundresses are included, and also
the fees paid for hotel and restaurant service, $300,000,000 seems a fair
estimate for the annual cash wages paid for domestic service.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> This estimate supposes the actual cost of board for each employee to
be $3.00 per week, which is probably less than would be paid by each
employee for table-board of the quality furnished by the employer. It
excludes the cost of house-rent furnished, and also fuel and light, all
of which are factors to be considered in computing the cost of service
received.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> It is difficult to estimate the value of the materials of which domestic
employees have the almost exclusive control. If the number of domestic
servants and launderers and laundresses in private families, hotels, and
restaurants is placed at 1,700,000, the number of employees in each family
as two, and the number of persons in each family, including servants, as
seven, it will be seen that at a rough estimate the food and laundried
articles of clothing of six million persons pass through the hands of this
class of employees. It was formerly a common saying, “a servant eats
her wages, breaks her wages, and wastes her wages.” If this verdict of
experience is taken as approximately true rather than as scientifically
exact, it will be seen that the actual expense involved in domestic
service is probably double that included under the items of wages and
support.</p>

<p>A young woman in search of employment was told that by going on
board ship she would find it in Virginia, a few miles below on the
Thames. Another young woman was persuaded to enter the ship, and
was then sold into service. Cited by Bruce, I., 614, from <i>Interregnum
Entry Book</i>, vol. 106, p. 84, and <i>British State Papers, Colonial</i>, vol.
XIII., No. 29, 1.</p>

<p>The evil of “spiriting away” both children and adults became so
great that in 1664 the Committee for Foreign Plantations interposed, and
the Council created the office of Register, charged with the duty of keeping
a record of all persons going to America as servants, and the statement
that they had voluntarily left England. This act was soon followed
by another fixing the penalty of death, without benefit of clergy, in
every case where persons were found guilty of kidnapping children or
adults. But even these extreme measures did not put an end to the evil;
and it is stated that ten thousand persons were annually kidnapped after
the passage of the act. Bruce, I., 614-619.</p>

latter writing of the funeral says: “I made a good Fire, set Chairs, and
gave Sack.” <i>Diary</i>, III., 394. <i>The New England Weekly Journal</i>, February
24, 1729, has a detailed account of the funeral: “A long train
followed him to the grave, it’s said about 150 black, and about 50 whites,

at table with their masters “as they say to save time” and adds, “into
the dish goes the black hoof, as freely as the white hand.” She relates a
difficulty between a master and a slave which was referred to arbitration,
each party binding himself to accept the decision. The arbitrators ordered
the master to pay 40 shillings to the slave and to acknowledge his
fault. “And so the matter ended: the poor master very honestly standing
to the award.”—<i>The Journal of Madame Knight.</i></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_53" href="#FNanchor_53" class="label">[53]</a> John Winter writes from Maine, “I Can not Conceaue which way
their masters Can pay yt, but yf yt Continue this rates the servants will
be masters &amp; the masters servants.” <i>Trelawny Papers</i>, p. 164. John
Winthrop makes a similar comment in narrating “a passage between one
Rowley and his servant. The master, being forced to sell a pair of oxen to
pay his servant his wages, told his servant he could keep him no longer, not
knowing how to pay him the next year. The servant answered, he would
serve him for more of his cattle. But how shall I do (saith the master)
when all my cattle are gone? The servant replied, you shall then serve
me, and so you may have your cattle again.” Winthrop gives as a reason
for high wages the fact that “the wars in England kept servants from
coming to us, so as those we had could not be hired, when their times
were out, but upon unreasonable terms, and we found it very difficult to
pay their wages to their content, (for money was very scarce).”—<i>History
of New England</i>, II., 219-220.</p>

means for the recovery of a servant when ill, and turned him away, he
forfeited five pounds for each servant so turned away, and if this was not
sufficient the Court was empowered to levy an additional amount. Such
servants on their recovery were to have their freedom, provided they had
not brought the illness on themselves. In Connecticut if the injury came
at the hands of the master or any member of his family, the master was
obliged to provide for the maintenance of the servant, even after the expiration
of his term of service, according to the judgment of the Court.
But if the injury “came by any providence of God without the default
of the family of the governor,” the master was released from the obligation
of providing for him after his term of service expired. In South
Carolina masters turning away sick or infirm servants were to forfeit
twenty pounds.</p>

these, five became members of the Assembly, one became a sheriff, and

are found in Virginia. Neill, <i>Virginia Carolorum</i>, p. 297. Sometimes,
however, the trail of the serpent remained. R. G., in a treatise
published about 1661, says of the burgesses that they “were usually such
as went over servants thither, and though by time, and industry, they
may have attained competent estates, yet by reason of their poor and
mean condition, were unskilful in judging of a good estate, either of
church or Commonwealth, or by the means of procuring it.”—<i>Virginia

<p>James Russell Lowell commenting on this letter says, “Let any housewife
of our day, who does not find the Keltic element in domestic life so
refreshing as to Mr. Arnold in literature, imagine a household with one
wild Pequot woman, communicated with by signs, for its maid of all
work, and take courage. Those were serious times indeed, when your

submitted to guide friends in France thinking of coming to America,
says: “You may also own negroes and negresses; there is not a house in
Boston, however small may be its means, that has not one or two. There
are those that have five or six, and all make a good living.”—Pp. 19-20.</p>

<p>The New England papers, even in the first part of the eighteenth century,
are full of advertisements like the following: “A Negro Wench
with a Girl Four Years old both born in the Country, used to all Family
work on a Farm, to be sold on reasonable Terms.”—<i>Boston News Letter</i>,
October 5, 1719.</p>

<p>“A very likely young Negro Wench that can do any Household Work
to be sold, inquire of Mr. Samuel Sewall.”—<i>Ibid.</i>, April 9, 1716.</p>

<p>“Lately arrived from Jamaica several Negro boys and girls, to be sold
by Mr. John Charnock &amp; Co.”—<i>Ibid.</i>, May 11, 1719.</p>

<p>Most of the advertisements describe those offered for sale as “very
likely,” and add the specially desirable qualification that he or she “speaks
good English.” Judge Sewall, in 1700, gives this account of his first protest
against negro slavery: “Having been long and much dissatisfied
with the Trade of fetching Negros from Guinea; at last I had a strong
Inclination to Write something about it; but it wore off. At last reading
Bayne, Ephes. about servants, who mentions Blackmoors; I began
to be uneasy that I had so long neglected doing anything.”—<i>Diary</i>,
II., 16.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_149" href="#FNanchor_149" class="label">[149]</a> But it is of interest in passing to note two contemporaneous judgments
on the effect of slavery. Elkanah Watson, writing of his journey
through the South in 1778, says: “The influence of slavery upon southern
habits is peculiarly exhibited in the prevailing indolence of the people. It
would seem as if the poor white man had almost rather starve than work,
because the negro works.”—<i>Men and Times</i>, p. 72.</p>

<p>Thomas Anburey writes, “Most of the planters consign the care of
their plantations and negroes to an overseer, even the man whose house
we rent, has his overseer, though he could with ease superintend it himself;
but if they possess a few negroes, they think it beneath their dignity,
added to which, they are so abominably lazy.”—<i>Travels</i>, II., 328.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_150" href="#FNanchor_150" class="label">[150]</a> A New England woman writes: “In several instances our ‘help’ was
married from our parlor with my sisters for bridesmaids. I correspond
with a woman doctor in Florida whose sister was our cook when I was a
child, and who shared her sister’s room at our home while she earned her
education, alternating work in the cotton mills and going to school.” This
is but one illustration of hundreds that have doubtless come within the
experience of most persons living in New England fifty years ago.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_151" href="#FNanchor_151" class="label">[151]</a> A visit to many New England burying grounds will illustrate this
statement. It was doubtless a survival of the English custom. A curious

J. Munby.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_153" href="#FNanchor_153" class="label">[153]</a> Even Americans commented on it. John Watson writes: “One of
the remarkable incidents of our republican principles of equality is the
hirelings, who in times before the war of Independence were accustomed
to accept the names of servants and to be drest according to their condition,
will now no longer suffer the former appellation; and all affect the
dress and the air, when abroad, of genteeler people than their business
warrants. Those, therefore, who from affluence have many dependents,
find it a constant subject of perplexity to manage their pride and assumption.”—<i>Annals</i>,

<p>It is of interest to contrast this picture of service in America by an
Englishwoman with one given a little earlier of service in England by an
American. Elkanah Watson writes from London in 1782: “The servants
attending upon my friend’s table were neatly dressed, and extremely
active and adroit in performing their offices, and glided about the room
silent and attentive. Their silence was in striking contrast with the volubility
of the French attendants, who, to my utter astonishment, I have
often observed in France, intermingling in the conversation of the table.
Here, the servant, however cherished, is held at an awful distance. The
English servant is generally an ignorant and servile being, who has no
aspiration beyond his present condition.”—<i>Men and Times of the Revolution</i>,

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_180" href="#FNanchor_180" class="label">[180]</a> This is indicated by the various definitions given in early dictionaries.
It is a curious fact that <i>The New World of Words or General English
Dictionary</i>, large quarto, third edition, London, 1671, does not contain
the word “servant.” Phillips’ <i>Universal English Dictionary</i>, London,
1720, has “<i>servant</i>, a man or woman who serves another.” Bailey’s
<i>Dictionary</i>, London, 1721, 1737, and 1770, defines servant as “one
who serves another.” <i>The Royal Standard English Dictionary</i>, first
American edition, Worcester, Massachusetts, 1788, “being the first
work of the kind printed in America,” defines <i>servant</i> as “one who
serves.” The second edition, Brookfield, 1804, has “<i>servant</i>, one who
serves for wages.”</p>

<p>Some interesting illustrations of this early use of the word are found
in colonial literature. Thus Thomas Morton in his <i>New English Canaan</i>,
p. 179, says, “In the month of June Anno Salutis, 1622, it was my
chance to arrive in the parts of New England with thirty servants and
provisions of all sorts fit for a plantation.”</p>

<p>Governor Bradford in his <i>History of Plymouth</i>, pp. 235-236, speaks of
“Captaine Wolastone and with him 3. or 4. more of some eminencie,
who brought with them a great many servants, with provisions &amp; other
implments fit for to begine a plantation.”</p>

<p>A “Narrative concerning the settlement of New England,” 1630, says,</p>

<p>“This yeare there went hence 6 shippes with 1000 people in them to the

this man (a backwoodsman of the Alleghanies) my servant, yet he himself

desire.”—<i>Tour in the United States</i>, I., 356.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_183" href="#FNanchor_183" class="label">[183]</a> An illustration of this change is seen in the different definitions
given to the word. In the <i>Royal Standard English Dictionary</i>, 1813,
a servant is “one who attends and obeys another, one in a state of
subjection.”</p>

<p>Johnson’s <i>Dictionary</i>, London, 1818, gives: “(1) One who attends
another and acts at his command; the correlative of master. Used of
man or woman. (2) One in a state of subjection.”</p>

<p>Richardson’s <i>New Dictionary of the English Language</i>, London, 1838,
defines <i>servant</i> as the correlative of <i>master</i>.</p>

<p>The American usage was practically the same. The first edition of
Webster, 1828, gives: “(1) Servant, a person, male or female, that attends
another for the purpose of performing menial offices for him,
or who is employed by another for such offices, or for other labor, and
is subject to his command. <i>Servant</i> differs from <i>slave</i>, as the servant’s
subjection to a master is voluntary, the slave’s is not. Every slave is
a servant, but every servant is not a slave.”</p>

<p>Worcester, 1860, says of <i>servant</i>: “(1) One who serves, whether
male or female; correlative of <i>master</i>, <i>mistress</i>, or <i>employer</i>. (2)
One in a state of subjection; a menial; a domestic; a drudge; a
slave.”</p>

<p>These various definitions all suggest the class association of the terms
“servant” and “slave.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_184" href="#FNanchor_184" class="label">[184]</a> A curious illustration of the social position of servants in Europe is
seen in their lack of political privileges.</p>

<p>The French Constitution of 1791 was preceded by a bill of rights
declaring the equality and brotherhood of men, but a disqualification for
the right of suffrage, indeed, the only one, was “to be in a menial
capacity, <i>viz.</i>, that of a servant receiving wages.” Title III., chap. 1,
sec. 2. The Constitution of 1795, after a similar preamble, states that
the citizenship is suspended “by being a domestic on wages, attending
on the person or serving the house.” Title II., 13, 3. The Constitution
of 1799 has a similar disqualification. Title I., art. 5. It is probable
that these provisions were intended to punish men who would consent
to serve the nobility or the wealthy classes when it was expected that
all persons would be democratic enough to serve themselves, not to cast
discredit on domestic service <i>per se</i>.—Tripier, pp. 20, 105, 168.</p>

<p>During the revolutionary movement in Austria, the Hungarian Diet
at its session, in 1847-1848, passed an act providing that the qualification
for electors should be “to have attained the age of twenty years; Hungarians
by birth or naturalized; not under guardianship, nor in domestic
service, nor convicted of fraud, theft, murder, etc.” Act 5, sec.
2.—Stiles, II., 376.</p>

<p>The qualifications for suffrage in England also excluded domestic
servants, but there was no discrimination against them as a class.</p>

<p>The Declaration of Independence, declaring all men free and equal in
the presence of African slavery, thus has its counterpart in these free
constitutions disfranchising domestic servants.</p>

<p>“(1) How long have you known her?</p>

<p>(2) Is she temperate, honest, and respectable?</p>

<p>(3) Is she neat in her person, and about her work?</p>

<p>(4) Is she of good disposition?</p>

<p>(6) In what capacity did she serve you, and how long?</p>

<p>(7) Was she capable and efficient in that capacity?”</p>

<p>The bureau states its aim to be “the recommendation of worthy persons
only.” The detailed form of the questions asked is more successful
in preventing an evasion of disqualifications, than is the personal
recommendation of a general character, which often tells the truth, but
not the whole truth.</p>

<p>One large bureau states that it formerly used blank forms, which it
sent out with each employee. Employers were asked to fill out these
blanks and return them at the end of service, and these were kept on
file as recommendations. It was soon found that employers grew lax
and would not take the pains to fill them out, and the practice was
abandoned.</p>

would keep me from being a servant. Mrs. X has been very kind to
me, and tried to find me other work; but, of course, a girl who has
been in a kitchen for so long (thirteen years) is inexperienced in different
work. Nevertheless, I have met girls who had no better education
than I, and now hold high and respectable positions and make a
fair living.”</p>

<p>A colored man, who has been a cook for forty years, replies with some
caution: “I don’t know, unless the other work was in sight. Can’t
say, unless somebody had done offered me another job, and I could look
into it.”</p>

apparently nearly every form of work in every kind of mill and
factory, farm work, cigar-making, sewing, dressmaking, millinery, tailoring,
crocheting, lace-making, carpet-making, copying; places as cash girls,
saleswomen, nurses, post-office clerks, compositors, office attendants; six

choose housework in preference to any other, principally because for that
I receive better pay. The average pay for store and factory girls is eight
and nine dollars a week. After paying board and room rent, washing,
etc., very little is left, and what is left must be spent for dress—nothing
saved.”</p>

<p>“It pays better than other kinds of work.”</p>

<p>“My expenses are less than in any other kind of work.”</p>

<p>“I can make more. I have put $100 in the savings bank in a year and

<p>“I can save more.”</p>

<p>“I can earn more without constant change.”</p>

<p>“I can earn more than in anything else ($15 a month), but do not save
anything as I support my mother.”</p>

<p>“Any one that is industrious and saving can save a great deal by
working at housework.”</p>

<p>“I began to live out when I was thirteen years old, and I am now
twenty-seven. I have saved $1600 in that time. At first I had $.50 a
week; now I have $3.00. One summer I earned $3.00 a day in the hop-picking
season.”</p>

providing that every domestic servant in the colony is to have a
half-holiday every Wednesday, and that the employer is to be fined £5 if
the domestic is deprived of this privilege. The “half-holiday” practically

“From the steward of your household, to your <i>jinrikisha</i> man or groom,
every servant in your establishment does what is right in his own eyes,
and after the manner he thinks best. Mere blind obedience to orders is not
regarded as a virtue in a Japanese servant; he must do his own thinking,
and, if he cannot grasp the reason for your order, that order will not be
carried out.” “Even in the treaty ports [Japanese attendants] have not
resigned their right of private judgment, but, if faithful and honest, seek
the best good of their employer, even if his best good involves disobedience
of his orders.”—Alice M. Bacon, <i>Japanese Girls and Women</i>,
pp. 299, 301.</p>

<p>F. R. Feudge, in <i>How I Kept House by Proxy</i>, quotes from her Chinese

housework for other people. I would prefer to do work where people
would say, supposing they were to give a company, ‘There is Miss So

who says she does housework because she likes to do it best,
and because a domestic can have better-cooked food and a better-ventilated
room than most shop-girls, and who also writes, “Intelligence, brains,
and good judgment are essential in getting up a dinner for six or eight.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_269" href="#FNanchor_269" class="label">[269]</a> One illustration of this social barrier was found in a small manufacturing
city. The factory employees, all men and skilled workmen,
arranged one winter a series of evening entertainments. Invitations were

milliners, stenographers, saleswomen, and others, but the social
line was drawn at cooks.</p>

narrated to a company of friends, and created much amusement, until
one said, “This shows how unregenerate we are; why should she not
take violin lessons?” It is not easy to find an answer.</p>

<p>A gentleman, whose family includes only himself and his wife, writes:
“Our maid-of-all-work is a young Swedish girl of eighteen, who recently
came to America. Three months ago she said, ‘If I had a musical instrument
and a place to practise, I would get a music teacher and stay with
you always.’ A few days later my married daughter sent us an organ of
sweet tone, which was placed in a small room little used. We gave our
maid permission to use it, and she at once secured a teacher. This morning
she said: ‘My father writes me if I am on the street much. I write
him, No, I enjoy myself better—I practise my music.’ We seem to have
solved the domestic question—at least for a time.”</p>

<p>“Domestics never have a chance to go to school or study.”</p>

<p>A domestic employee recently went to a public library for a book.
The attendant was about to give it to her, thinking from her manner and
appearance that she was a teacher in a neighboring school; but when the

former employer called on her one day, and said, “Well, Sarah, how do
you like your work?” She replied, “I never thought of it before, but
now that you speak, I think the reason I like it so well is because everybody
calls me ‘Miss Clark.’”</p>

<p>An employer invited her Sunday-school class to her home to spend an
evening. One of the members went into the kitchen to render some assistance,
and found there the housemaid, an unusually attractive young
woman. The employer said, “Miss M, this is Kate.” The maid, who

<p><a id="Footnote_275" href="#FNanchor_275" class="label">[275]</a> That this jest has a basis of fact in England is evident from the testimony

<p><a id="Footnote_277" href="#FNanchor_277" class="label">[277]</a> One illustration of the fact that domestic service is never judged by
the same social canons as are other occupations, is seen in the unwillingness
shown by a young woman to enter the service of a family having
a questionable reputation. Her “squeamishness,” as it was called, excited
only laughter in a circle of women, no one of whom would have
exchanged calls with the family in question.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_279" href="#FNanchor_279" class="label">[279]</a> An employer writes: “I recently advertised for a young woman to
help me with the children, and be received as one of the family. The
forty answers received formed the most pathetic reading I have ever
seen. My selection was the daughter of a poor clergyman, and this was
the class from which the majority of the answers came. All desired
domestic service if unaccompanied with social degradation.”</p>

<p>How conscious many are of this inferior position is seen from a single
illustration. An employer recently invited her housemaid to take a boat-ride
with her. The maid replied, “I should love to go if you wouldn’t
be ashamed to be seen with me.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_280" href="#FNanchor_280" class="label">[280]</a> This is especially true in the matter of wages where wages and annual
earnings are confused, the element of time lost never being considered.
The fact is also often overlooked that when a young woman
lives at home without paying her board, her family in effect pay a part
of her wages and thus enable the employer to pay her low wages, though
nominally more than paid in housework. Thus one employee writes:
“If girls have homes where their board is given them, they can earn
more money on other kinds of work than in housework.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_281" href="#FNanchor_281" class="label">[281]</a> Domestic service, as seen by the employee, cannot be dismissed without
suggesting the fact that as many tragedies in life are found here as
elsewhere. One employee had planned to be a teacher, but sudden deafness
prevented, and domestic service was all she could do. Another
hoped to become a physician, but loss of property prevented her from
completing her education. A similar reason prevented another from
becoming a trained nurse. One had hoped to be a dressmaker, but it
became necessary to earn money at once without serving an apprenticeship.
Could the struggles and disappointments in thousands of such
lives be known, the household employee would cease to be the butt of
jest and ridicule that she sometimes is.</p>

<p>The Charleston Employment Bureau advertises, “White help especially
in demand.” In Texas the proportion of the foreign born population
is larger than in any other of the Southern states, and advertisements
from all the leading cities in the state show a decided preference for German
or Swedish domestics. One from the <i>Fort Worth Gazette</i> reads,
“Wanted—A white woman (German or Swede preferred) as cook in a
private family.” This illustrates a large number of “wants.” An employer
writes from Austin, “In Texas cities domestic service is furnished
by Germans and Swedes to a large extent, and the tendency to employ
them is growing.”</p>

nothing to hope from it. I have been reared in the South, and I know
the negro well. Speaking as one with no sectional prejudice and with the
broadest sympathy for blacks as well as whites, I must tell you that in
general negroes will not serve you as well as the Irish, Germans, or

people.”</p>

<p>“I have grown up with Chinamen in the house, and it seems to me
quite revolting and unnatural to have in the heart of the house an alien
woman who speaks your language, knows your affairs, is even in a way
dependent on your companionship, yet is nothing to you as a friend, and
would never be asked even as a guest into the house if it rested on her
personal qualities.”—<i>San Francisco, California.</i></p>

<p>“Our Chinese cook is an admirable servant, invariably respectful, and
does his work beautifully; he has the self-respect to fill every requirement
of respectful and obedient behavior that the occasion calls for.”—<i>San

“They are a product of city life; a sort of vitalized machines, fitted

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_296" href="#FNanchor_296" class="label">[296]</a> The word “servant” has been used many times in this work, but it

term.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_297" href="#FNanchor_297" class="label">[297]</a> It has been suggested that the word “homemaker” be applied to the
mistress of the house and “housekeeper” to the employee; “working
housekeeper” is often used of an efficient caretaker who does her work
without direction; “domestic” and “house helper” seem wholly unobjectionable.
It certainly is not necessary in abandoning one objectionable
word to adopt another equally so. The Lynn, Massachusetts, papers, for
example, advertise under “wants” for a “forelady in stitching room,”
“a position as forewoman by a lady thoroughly familiar with all parts of
shoe stitching,” “on millinery an experienced saleslady.” In other places
one finds “a gentlewoman who desires employment at twenty-five cents
an hour.” The public has much to answer for in the misuse of both “servant”
and “lady.”</p>

New York an ingenious pea huller is in use which does away with much
of the laborious process hitherto necessary. In a trial of speed it was
recently found that one machine could shell twenty-eight bushels of peas
in twenty minutes. In some of the largest cities the principle has been
applied, and this vegetable is delivered ready for use; but such preparation
should be made universal and all other vegetables added to the list.</p>

maintained for some time such sales, and they have proved very remunerative.
In one city in New Jersey $1,200 was raised in a few weeks to pay
a church mortgage. In a Long Island village several hundred dollars
was raised for a similar purpose by the women of the church, who took
orders for cooking and sewing. In an Iowa city funds were obtained in
this way for missionary purposes. In a village of five hundred inhabitants,
in Central New York, the women of one of the churches have sold,
every Saturday afternoon for eight years, ices and ice-creams, and have
cleared annually about seventy-five dollars. In another town, several
women of limited incomes began paying their contributions to the
church by baking bread and cake for other families, and finding it remunerative
continued the work as a means of support. In one Western
city an annual sale is held at Thanksgiving time, and about one hundred
dollars netted for home missionary purposes.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_307" href="#FNanchor_307" class="label">[307]</a> Many illustrations of this can be given outside of those connected
with the Exchange:</p>

<p>Mrs. A, in Central New York, has made a handsome living by making
chicken salad to be sold in New York City.</p>

<p>Mrs. B, in a small Eastern village, has for several years baked bread,
pies, and cake for her neighbors, and in this way has supported herself,
three children, and a father. She has recently built a separate bakehouse,
and bakes from thirty to one hundred loaves daily, according to
the season, and other things in proportion. She says she always had a
“knack” at baking, and that when she employs an assistant she has
nearly every afternoon to herself.</p>

<p>Mrs. C, in a Western city, supports herself, three children, and an invalid
husband, by making cake.</p>

<p>Mrs. D makes a good living by selling Saratoga potatoes to grocers.</p>

<p>Mrs. E has cleared $400 a year by making preserves and jellies on
private orders.</p>

<p>Mrs. F partially supports herself and family by making food for the
sick.</p>

<p>Mrs. G supports a family of five by making jams and pickles.</p>

<p>Mrs. H has built up a large business, employing from three to five
assistants, in making cake and salad.</p>

<p>Mrs. I, in a small Eastern city, began by borrowing a barrel of flour,
and now has a salesroom where she sells daily from eighty to one hundred
dozen Parker House rolls, in addition to bread made in every possible
way, from every kind of grain.</p>

<p>Mrs. J, in a small Western city, sells salt-risings bread to the value of
$30 a week; and Mrs. K, in the same place, Boston brown bread to the
value of $75 a week.</p>

<p>Mrs. L, living on a farm near a Southern city, has built up “an exceedingly
remunerative business” by selling to city grocers preserves,
pickles, cakes, and pies. “One cause of her success has been the fact
that she would allow no imperfect goods to be sold; everything has been
of the best whether she has gained or lost on it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. M supports herself by taking orders for fancy cooking.</p>

<p>Mrs. N, living in a large city, sells to grocers baked beans and rolls.</p>

<p>Mrs. O, in New York City, has netted $1,000 a year by preparing
mince-meat and making pies of every description.</p>

<p>Mrs. P, in a small village on Lake Superior, has large orders from
cities in Southern Michigan for strawberry and raspberry jam.</p>

<p>Mrs. Q, in a country village of five hundred inhabitants, sells thirty
loaves of bread daily.</p>

<p>Mrs. R and two daughters last year netted $1,500 (above all expenses
except house rent) in preparing fancy lunch dishes on shortest notice, and
delicacies for invalids.</p>

<p>Mrs. S puts up pure fruit juices and shrubs.</p>

<p>Mrs. T prepares consommé in the form of jelly ready to melt and
serve.</p>

<p>Mrs. U has made a fair income by preparing and selling fresh sweet
herbs.</p>

<p>These illustrations can be multiplied indefinitely. They have come
to notice in nearly every state in the Union, and in places varying in size
from country villages without railroad stations to such cities as Chicago,
Philadelphia, and New York.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_308" href="#FNanchor_308" class="label">[308]</a> Mrs. A has for several years gone from house to house at stated
times sweeping and dusting rooms containing fine bric-à-brac.</p>

<p>Mr. B cares for all of the lawns of a large number of gentlemen, each
of whom pays him a fixed sum for the season in proportion to the size of
his grounds.</p>

<p>Mr. C cares for all of the furnaces and clears the walks in a city block.</p>

<p>Mrs. D earns a partial support by arranging tables for lunches and
afternoon teas.</p>

<p>Mrs. E washes windows once in two weeks for a number of employers.</p>

<p>Mrs. F takes charge of all arrangements for afternoon teas.</p>

<p>Mrs. G earns $3 a day as a cook on special occasions.</p>

<p>Miss H waits on a table in a boarding house three hours a day.</p>

<p>Miss I distributes the clothes from the laundry in a large city school.</p>

<p>Mrs. J is kept busy as a cook, serving as a substitute in kitchens temporarily
vacant.</p>

<p>Mrs. K derives a considerable income from the supervision of party
suppers. “Her social position is quite unaffected by it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. L “makes herself generally useful” at the rate of ten cents an
hour if regularly employed and twenty cents when serving occasionally.</p>

<p>Mrs. M goes out as a waitress at lunches and dinners.</p>

<p>Mrs. N employs a young man working his way through school to keep
wood-boxes and coal-hods filled.</p>

<p>Many college students in cities partially pay their expenses by table
service.</p>

<p>Hotels and restaurants frequently send out waiters on special occasions.</p>

<p>One employer writes, “I think a central office in this city at which
competent waitresses could be hired by the hour would be largely
patronized.”</p>

<p>The Syracuse, New York, Household Economic Club publishes a
<i>Household Register</i>, giving the names and addresses of all persons in the
city who do by the piece, hour, or day all forms of household work.
Thirty-five different classes of work are enumerated.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_309" href="#FNanchor_309" class="label">[309]</a> See also article on the “Revival of Hand Spinning and Weaving in

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_310" href="#FNanchor_310" class="label">[310]</a> One writes, “I find it much better to employ one servant and to hire
work by the piece, and to purchase from the Exchange, rather than to
employ an extra servant.”</p>

<p>Another housekeeper writes: “I began housekeeping twelve years
ago with three servants and had more than enough work for all. I now
have two and have not enough work for them, although my family is
larger than at first. The change has come from putting work out of the
house and hiring much done by the piece.”</p>

<p>A business man writes: “Our family is happier than it ever dared hope
to be under the sway of Green Erin. We purchase all baked articles and
all cooked meats as far as possible. A caterer is employed on special
occasions, and work that cannot be done by the parents, three children,
and two aunts, who compose the family, is hired by the hour. Since we
signed our Declaration of Independence in 1886, peace has reigned.”</p>

<p>Still another says: “I used to employ a laundress in the house at
$4 per week and board. I was also at expense in furnishing soap, starch,
bluing, and paid a large additional water tax. Now my laundress lives
at home, and does my laundry there for $4 per week, and we are both
better satisfied.”</p>

<p>Several small families who do “light housekeeping,” have found that
they have in this way been able to live near the business of the men of
the family, and thus have kept the family united and intact, as they
could not have done had it been necessary to employ servants.</p>

<p>One employee writes, “If more housework were done by the day so
that more women could be with their families in the evening, I think it
would help matters.”</p>

sum remains after these have been made. The family report that
they have never lived so well, or with so much comfort and so much economy
as since the plan has been tried.</p>

<p>Another states that she adds at the end of the month twenty per cent
to the wages of her waitress if no article of glass or china has been nicked,
cracked, or broken during the time.</p>

<p>These are all variations of the same principle.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_335" href="#FNanchor_335" class="label">[335]</a> This is apparently the case universally in France and in Italy. In
Italy, while the washing is always done out of the house, the ironing is
often done at home. In Lombardy “a woman of color” washes the
colored clothes and flannels, which are kept distinct from the ordinary
laundry. On the continent bed linen is often changed only once in two,
three, or even four weeks—a custom that has at least the advantage of
reducing to a minimum this part of the household work.</p>

<p>“In England it is becoming the rule, except in large households with
laundries of their own, and in households managed on narrow means, to
send this work out.”—Miss Collet, <i>Report</i>, p. 9.</p>

<p>“Washing is put out, as it is now almost impossible to get a girl who
will do it.”—Employer, cited by Miss Collet, <i>Report</i>, p. 30.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_337" href="#FNanchor_337" class="label">[337]</a> The legal relations between employer and employee are everywhere
prescribed with more or less fulness, but in Germany the laws are very
minute in character, while the contract in particular is much more rigid,
and it is carried out in much greater detail than elsewhere. The laws for
Prussia are given in Posseldt, while a summary for the Empire is given in
Braun. Each state has its own laws on the subject, but as far as I have
been able to examine them, they are practically the same in principle.</p>

<p>I am indebted to Mrs. John H. Converse for permission to use an
exhaustive statement of the legal relations between mistress and maid in
England prepared by Mrs. Henry C. Lea of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Weber, in <i>Les Usages locaux</i>, sums up many of the points in French
law.</p>

<p>“In England situations are usually subject to a month’s notice on
either side.”—Booth, VIII., 221.</p>

<p>No special contract is made in France, with the result that “one
changes domestics these days almost as often as political convictions.”—Weber,
p. 45.</p>

<p>In Italy, also, no special contract is required, though a servant cannot
be turned off without giving him ten days’ notice or a week’s wages.</p>

<p>But under many circumstances, specified with great exactness, a servant
may be legally dismissed without notice. Posseldt, pp. 64-70, gives
a list of nineteen cases where this may be done in Prussia; the laws for
Saxony are very similar (pp. 28-30); Braun, chap. XII., gives twenty-one.</p>

<p>The employee is also privileged under certain conditions to break the
contract without notice. Braun, chap. XII., enumerates seven. These

<p><a id="Footnote_344" href="#FNanchor_344" class="label">[344]</a> In England “the majority of adult male indoor domestic servants
are in large households employing over six servants.”—Miss Collet,
<i>Report</i>, p. 23.</p>

<p>“Every English man-servant is apt to consider himself a specialist....
This want of elasticity has led to his gradual disappearance from
all except the most wealthy households.”—Booth, VIII., 227.</p>

<p>In Italy cooks are very generally men. In France nearly all domestic
work in the provincial hotels is performed by men. In Germany waiters
are, as a rule, men.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_345" href="#FNanchor_345" class="label">[345]</a> This competition is not wholly unknown. In a pension in Athens
the second waiter, a Greek, left because unwilling to take orders from
an Armenian head waiter. French servants sometimes go to the French
cantons of Switzerland, and the reverse. The same is true of German
and Italian servants who are found in the German and the Italian cantons.
But the permanent migration of servants from one country to another,
especially on the continent, is very slight. The reason usually given is,
“They do not understand the ways of another country and are unhappy
in it.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_346" href="#FNanchor_346" class="label">[346]</a> “Not only will the foreigner work for less wages, but he is better
educated and more thoroughly trained. Whilst in this country a waiter’s
duties are ‘picked up’ in an irregular way, in Germany or Switzerland
the work is properly taught by a regular system of apprenticeship. The
knowledge of continental language which the foreigner possesses is found
useful, and he has, moreover, a higher reputation than our own countrymen
for neatness and civility.”—Booth, VIII., 235.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_347" href="#FNanchor_347" class="label">[347]</a> English, French, and German are universally spoken by waiters in
all the large hotels and pensions on the continent. Two or three other
languages in addition are often found. One waiter in a very primitive
hotel in Olympia, Greece, spoke eight. This can scarcely be considered
exceptional. “The waiting staff of the great modern hotels consists
mainly of foreigners.”—Booth, VIII., 231-232.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_348" href="#FNanchor_348" class="label">[348]</a> In certain quarters of London the boarding-houses are full of waiters
who have come over from the continent to learn English. Many waiters
not French by birth took advantage of the Exposition in 1900 to improve
their French by going to Paris at that time. It is not unusual for travellers
to be asked concerning possible openings in hotels and pensions
where waiters would have an opportunity of learning a new language.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_349" href="#FNanchor_349" class="label">[349]</a> For wages in England, see Miss Collet, <i>Report on the Money Wages
of Indoor Domestic Servants</i>, and Booth, VIII., 217, 221-224, 227-228,
231-235; for wages in France, M. Bienaymé in <i>Journal de la Société de
Statistique de Paris</i>, November, 1899, and M. Salomon in <i>La Nouvelle
Revue</i>, February 1, 1886. I have been unable to find satisfactory statistics
concerning the wages paid in Germany and in Italy. Numerous
inquiries lead me to believe that they are somewhat lower in Italy and
in Spain than elsewhere (an English housekeeper residing in Spain for
twenty-five years reports that general servants in Spain receive from
$1.25 to $2.00 a month, cooks, who are considered “artists,” receiving
somewhat more), and that in Germany the variations are not so great as in
England in the wages paid in different classes of society. This, however,
is but an impression, and the judgment cannot be considered authoritative.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_350" href="#FNanchor_350" class="label">[350]</a> “We understand that the plan of paying board-wages throughout the
year instead of providing food is increasing, and is usually at the rate of
16<i>s.</i> per week for upper men-servants, 14<i>s.</i> for footmen, and 12<i>s.</i> to 14<i>s.</i>
for women-servants.”—Booth, VIII., 230.</p>

<p>“Another disturbing feature in many Irish households is the practice
of paying ‘breakfast wages’ in some cases, and ‘full board’ wages in
others.”—Miss Collet, <i>Report</i>, p. 10.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_351" href="#FNanchor_351" class="label">[351]</a> M. Babeau says that in France as far back as 1692 a good cook
expected presents at Easter and on Saint Martin’s day as well as at New
Year’s. P. 283.</p>

<p>“To the 600 francs (given a domestic in the fashionable quarters of
Paris) must be added gifts and New Year’s presents.”—M. Jules Simon,
cited by M. Salomon, p. 549.</p>

<p>“A usually substantial Christmas box is given the waiters in West-End
London clubs.”—Booth, VIII., 231.</p>

<p>In Germany, while a servant cannot legally claim presents at Christmas,
New Year’s, and similar times (<i>Welche Rechte und Pflichten haben
Herrschaft und Gesinde?</i> p. 30), the custom of giving them is universal.
“I would not <i>dare</i> to give less than thirty marks at Christmas to the cook
and twenty marks to the chambermaid.”—German housekeeper, Dresden.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon in Germany for housekeepers to give presents on the
anniversaries of the days their servants come to them, and medals on special
anniversaries, as the tenth or twenty-fifth. This explains the custom of the
German Housewives’ Society in New York of presenting $10 gold pieces to
employees who have served faithfully for two years in the home of a member
of the society. <i>The Evening Post</i> (New York), December 12, 1900.</p>

<p>“I always give my cook twenty lire at Christmas and ten lire at the
fête of the Madonna.”—Italian housekeeper, Milan.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_352" href="#FNanchor_352" class="label">[352]</a> “I often give a present of two marks between times, pay often for

have to do.”—German housekeeper, Berlin.</p>

<p>The traditional reply ascribed to Hanway (Bouniceau-Gesmon, p. 134)
in declining an invitation from an English lord, “I am not rich enough

<p>“Vails to servants in households where a considerable number of
visitors are entertained must be an important item in the real earnings
of servants.”—Miss Collet, <i>Report</i>, p. 29.</p>

<p>An admirable discussion of the whole subject of fees paid by guests is
given by W. J. Stillman in <i>The Nation</i>, October 11, 1900. See also <i>The
Nation</i>, November 8, 1900. Mr. Albert Matthews in <i>The Nation</i>, December
13, 1900, cites an extract from the London <i>Chronicle</i> that shows that
the custom dates back certainly as far as 1765.</p>

<p>Babeau, pp. 301-302, discusses the abuses of the custom in France,
though they are less there than in Italy, and especially in England “where
one cannot go out to dine without encountering, on leaving, all the servants
drawn up in line and holding out their hands.”</p>

housekeeper, Berlin.</p>

<p>“The ‘sou in the franc’ that certain tradesmen agree to give servants
is not only tolerated, but it is recognized as a right.”—M. G. Salomon,
p. 549.</p>

<p>“In the expression ‘theft’ we do not hesitate to include the ‘dancing
of the basket’; the ‘sou in the franc’ given by some dealers does not
constitute an act of disloyalty on the part of the domestic. It is for the
master, if he would escape this tax, to levy it on the tradesmen less clever
in advertising, unless he is very sure that the merchant makes the servant
this allowance <i>out of his profits alone</i>.”—Weber, p. 47.</p>

<p>“In fact, the part taken by our servants in the purchase and use of
almost all articles of consumption makes a necessary increase in the
wages paid. Thus even before coming to the kitchen, provisions undergo
an increase in cost from the fact that they are bought by the mercenary
person who attends to the marketing; this does not include customary
augmentations, the sou per pound or the sou in the franc, said to be met
by the merchant, and certain others which, on account of their constant
increase, deserve special mention.”—Bienaymé, pp. 366-367.</p>

<p>“What is done by these servants hired for a limited time? They go
to the merchant and impose upon him the law of division of profits.
The merchant raises the price, and the stranger buys the article for more
than it should cost. These servants even levy a tax upon the eating-house
keeper; the livery-stable keeper is obliged to pay them as much as twenty
sous a day; these profits have become customary.”—Mercier, V., 156.</p>

<p>Bouniceau-Gesmon, pp. 107-113, cites from an unnamed English
author a long account of similar practices in England.</p>

get various profits, such as ashes, old shoes, remnants of bread and meat,

<p>M. Babeau, p. 283, cites from Fournier, <i>Vanités historiques et littéraires</i>,
V., 243-257, the advice of an old servant to a new one as to ways
of cheating his master, such as burning much wood in order to have many
ashes, saving from articles for the table, etc. It is thus that a cook has
been able to lay up enough to buy five large farms, while her husband,
the coachman, has on his part saved out of the hay and straw bought for
the stables.</p>

<p>“A large number of cooks increase these profits by illicit gains, and
the tradesmen themselves, with no other reason than the fear of losing
their customers, obligingly wink at, or rather become parties in, this trickery.”—M.

<p>“The cook either brings short weight or reports paying a higher price

<p><a id="Footnote_359" href="#FNanchor_359" class="label">[359]</a> The laws of insurance against accident, sickness, invalidism, and old
age compel the employer to pay one-half the insurance,—about three
dollars per year. It is said, however, that as a rule the employer pays
the entire amount. It is true this amount is small in families employing
but one servant and paying low wages, but where several servants are
kept and high wages given the total amount is considerable. On the
other hand, the burden is often relatively, though not absolutely, heavier
in the family with one servant on low wages, since this means a small
income. The amount of insurance varies with the wages, but the wages
received by most domestics place them in Class II. The government
rates board and lodging received by servants at 350<i>M.</i> per annum, and
this with the cash wages received puts the insurance at about three dollars
annually, an amount slightly in excess of that paid by the employees in
Class I. See <i>Unfallversicherungsgesetz</i>, <i>Krankenversicherungsgesetz</i>, and
<i>Das Reichsgesetz über die Invaliditäts- und Altersversicherung</i>. Each of

through employment bureaus, personal recollections, household expense
books, and similar means, to give the wages paid in France since 1815.
The results of his investigations seem to show that wages in nearly every
branch of domestic service have steadily increased since that time, until
now the wages of an ordinary cook are 50 francs per month and a
chambermaid the same, while a general servant receives 40 francs per
month, the wages of all these classes of house servants having doubled
the past sixty years. At the same time the cost of maintenance has also
increased. He gives a table showing the increase, or in some cases the
decrease, in wages in every branch of domestic service during this period.
<i>Journal de la Société de Statistique de Paris</i>, November, 1899.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_364" href="#FNanchor_364" class="label">[364]</a> Mr. William Clarke, in <i>The Social Future of England</i>, sums up the
character of domestic service in England in saying: “It is true that English
middle-class service is bad, and even growing worse, and this will continue
so long as factory labor is preferred to domestic service. But there
is probably no country where the wealthy can secure such efficient and
fairly honest service in the butler, valet, lady’s maid, and housekeeper
lines as in England.”—<i>The Contemporary Review</i>, December, 1900.</p>

<p>The historical question whether the character of the service has ever
been any better than it is at present must also remain unanswered for the
same reason. Pandolfini in <i>Il Governo della Famiglia</i> finds the philosophical
explanation of poor service in Italy during the fifteenth century
in the tendency of servants to seek their own interests rather than those
of their masters—an explanation limited by neither time nor place. All
literature goes to show that our own age is not alone in finding it difficult
to secure those who will “carry the message to Garcia.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_368" href="#FNanchor_368" class="label">[368]</a> The living accommodations provided for employees seemed to me
everywhere distinctly inferior to those provided in America. In London,
“as far as possible the men are lodged in the basement, while the women
have their rooms at the top of the house. This arrangement, though
always desirable, often necessitates two or even three men using the servants’
hall as their bedroom, while another sleeps in the pantry, and another
beneath the stairs. Breathing space is restricted and the want of air,
and high living, coupled with the absence of hard work or exercise, lead
naturally to a demand for some form of stimulant, with the result that
numbers of men-servants ultimately take to drink.”—Booth, VIII.,
228-229. The sleeping rooms given servants are small and cheerless,
hot in summer and cold in winter, while often the only place provided
for taking meals is a corner of the kitchen table.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_369" href="#FNanchor_369" class="label">[369]</a> Bouniceau-Gesmon finds a fundamental difference between slavery
and domestic service, as indeed there is, and denies that one is the outgrowth
of the other, since the two have sometimes existed side by side.
<i>Domestiques et Maîtres</i>, chap. I. But while the one is bond and the
other free, and while the labor performed in both states is the same and
should be honorable, the fact remains that the domestic servant has
inherited to a great degree the social opprobrium that attached to the
slave and the serf.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_370" href="#FNanchor_370" class="label">[370]</a> Gil Blas, Figaro, and Lafleur have long stood as types of the eighteenth
century valet. Walter Scott says of the former, “as to respect,
it is the last thing which he asks at his reader’s hand.” [<i>Biographical Memoir of Le Sage.</i>] Both Dean
Swift and Daniel DeFoe sharpened their pens with infinite pains in describing
the servants of their times. At a later date the pencil of Cruikshank
found employment in illustrating Mayhew’s <i>Greatest Plague in Life</i>,
while <i>Punch</i> for years revelled in the opportunities afforded by “servant-gallism.”
Babeau, Bouniceau-Gesmon, and Salomon show similar conditions
in France. “Stealing is an infamous thing—it is the sin of a
lackey,” remarks a priest to a pupil who confessed a theft. Cited by
Babeau, p. 290. “To lie like a lackey” is almost proverbial.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_371" href="#FNanchor_371" class="label">[371]</a> There are indeed many illustrations of servants of an altogether different
character—Caleb in <i>The Bride of Lammermoor</i> and Marcel in <i>The
Huguenots</i> are types of the faithful servitor who alike in prosperity and
in adversity remains constant to the family in whose service he was born.
The fact remains, however, that the servant exists as a type in European
literature as he does not in that of America.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_373" href="#FNanchor_373" class="label">[373]</a> “It is, in fact, almost necessary to have an inherited aptitude for the
relationship involved—a relationship very similar in some respects to that
subsisting between sovereign and subject. From both servant and subject
there is demanded an all-pervading attitude of watchful respect, accompanied
by a readiness to respond at once to any gracious advance
that may be made without ever presuming or for a moment ‘forgetting
themselves.’”—Booth, VIII., 225.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_374" href="#FNanchor_374" class="label">[374]</a> “The habits of servants in large houses and the strict observance of
etiquette give rise to some very curious customs. There are three grades
of servants, named ‘kitchen,’ ‘hall,’ and ‘room,’ after the places in
which they take their meals.”—Booth, VIII., 229.</p>

<p>“There is no class less open to democratic ideas than a contented servant
class. Compared with them their titled and wealthy employers are
revolutionists. They cannot bear change, their minds are saturated with
the idea of social grades and distinctions, they will not even live with one
another on terms of social equality.”—William Clarke, <i>Contemporary
Review</i>, December, 1900.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_375" href="#FNanchor_375" class="label">[375]</a> Mercier speaks of establishments where valets and maids had themselves
valets and lackeys (XI., 277), and says that generally a lackey in
the upper classes takes the name of his master when he goes with other
lackeys, as he also adopts his customs, his gestures, his manners, carries
a gold watch, and wears lace; a lackey <i>du dernier ton</i> even wears two
watches like his master (II., 124).</p>

<p>“The maid of a visitor ranks, of course, with the upper servants.
She is addressed not by her own name, but by the surname or title of her
mistress.”—Booth, VIII., 230.</p>

<p>An interesting illustration of the social stratification in England is
suggested by the sermons delivered to servants by the late Master of
Balliol. <i>Sermons</i>, pp. vii., 348. Lewis Carroll “was always ready and
willing to preach at the special service for college servants which used to
be held at Christ Church every Sunday evening.”—Collingwood, <i>Life
and Letters of Lewis Carroll</i>, p. 77.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_378" href="#FNanchor_378" class="label">[378]</a> The home for aged servants in Dresden is under the immediate patronage
of the Queen. In 1892, when visited, it had accommodations for
fifteen women who must be at least sixty-two years old and give proof of
having been a servant before being admitted. It does not apparently
differ in principle from a well-conducted old ladies’ home except that its
inmates must all have been servants.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_379" href="#FNanchor_379" class="label">[379]</a> There are many of these homes where girls out of employment can
have comfortable accommodations at a reasonable rate. One of the most
interesting is the “Heimatshaus für Mädchen” in Berlin. In 1892 it was
located under the “Stadtbahn” or elevated railroad of the city. Under
pressure it could accommodate two hundred and was constantly increasing
its facilities. In 1891 five thousand girls had found in it a temporary
home. They remained on an average about five days. Each occupant
pays 25 pfennigs for lodging, 10 for coffee, 15 for dinner, and 10 for supper.
Even at these very low rates the home is self-supporting. The only
source of income is the fees paid to the employment bureau carried on in
connection with the home. Every employer pays 3 marks when he secures
a servant through the bureau, and every employee pays the same when a
place is secured. That the class of servants who frequent it have a family
likeness to their sisters in America was indicated by the questions overheard
asked by would-be servants of prospective employers: “How many
children are there in the family?” “How many servants do you keep?”
“Is there running water in your flat?” “How many flights up do you
live?”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_380" href="#FNanchor_380" class="label">[380]</a> The Sonntags-Verein has its headquarters in Berlin where in 1892 it
had twenty-nine unions under its charge, with one hundred and twenty-one
in other parts of Germany and six in Russia, England, and Austria.
Its work is almost exclusively religious in character, but entertainment is
provided consisting of music, games, and reading, and beer or tea is served
with bread and butter. About fifteen hundred girls were members of the
Berlin branches in 1892. The difficulty of starting and maintaining these
unions was very great. The free time of household employees is every
other or every third Sunday afternoon, so that attendance is very irregular
and interest correspondingly fluctuating. Employers often discourage the
attendance of their employees, saying that they need rest rather than recreation,
while the girls themselves often prefer the coffee-houses or beer
gardens. The <i>Deutsche Mädchen-Zeitung</i> in 1892 had been published
twenty-three years in the interests of the Verein and had a circulation of
four thousand copies. These, however, were not taken by the girls themselves,
but by their employers for them. “The Germans never wish to
pay for anything themselves, they wish everything given them,” said a
German employer in explanation. The Sonntags-Verein owed its inception
to the interest in the class of household employees taken by Frau
Banquier Lösche, and since her death, four years ago, the work has been
carried on by her daughter.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_381" href="#FNanchor_381" class="label">[381]</a> These usually receive young girls after they have been confirmed,—at
about fourteen years of age,—and train them in everything pertaining to
the house. They do not naturally at that age go of their own accord, but
they are taken by their parents or guardians who often sign a contract,
agreeing that the girl will remain in the school at least one or two years,
as the case may be. The schools are well attended, and the girls apparently
contented.</p>

<p>Edward S. Joynes, in his report on the <i>Industrial Education of Women
in Germany</i> (Columbia, S.C., 1896), gives a full description of the training
in domestic work given in the regular German industrial schools for
girls.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_382" href="#FNanchor_382" class="label">[382]</a> At least two important historical studies of the topic have been
made,—one by Mr. Albert Matthews on “The Terms Hired Man and
Help,” and one by Mr. James D. Butler on “British Convicts Shipped to
American Colonies.” Statistical investigations of the subject have been
carried on by the state bureaus of labor in Minnesota, Colorado, and Indiana.
The Massachusetts bureau has collated the results of investigations
made by the Women’s Educational and Industrial Union of Boston, Miss
Isabel Eaton has made an exhaustive study of negro domestic service in
the seventh ward of the city of Philadelphia, different branches of the Association
of Collegiate Alumnæ have carried on valuable local inquiries into
the question, while the bureau of labor in Washington is about undertaking
a comprehensive study of the entire subject. The New York state
library has issued a full list of articles and books bearing on the matter, and
the city libraries of Providence, Rhode Island, and Salem, Massachusetts,
have published similar lists. In view of these facts it seems not unreasonable
to make the above claim.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">SCHEDULE No. I.—EMPLOYERS</span><br>
STATISTICS OF DOMESTIC SERVICE</h4>

<p>The graduates of Vassar College, Classes of ’88 and ’89,
desire to collect statistics in regard to the subject of domestic
service, and ask your assistance.</p>

<p>The work has grown out of a belief that a knowledge of
some of the actual conditions of such service, as viewed from
the standpoint of both employer and employee, is essential to
an intelligent discussion of this question. It is hoped to tabulate
the results obtained, showing the average wages paid in
each occupation, the length of time employed, etc. The statistics,
to be of value, must represent the experiences of many
housekeepers in many localities, and the co-operation of all
who are interested in the subject is earnestly solicited. Three
schedules are sent you upon which to supply information.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Schedule No. I.</span>—For Employers (mistresses of households).</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Schedule No. II.</span>—For Employees (domestic servants of
all kinds).</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Schedule No. III.</span>—For Educational Statistics (from teachers,
etc., in the kinds of schools specified).</p>

</div>

<p>These schedules are sent to all housekeepers and their employees
who can be communicated with by the members of the
Classes of ’88 and ’89 and the Department of History.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span></p>

<p>Will you please fill out the following blank and return it to
the person sending it to you, or to the address given below?
Please complete all the columns relating to each person in
your employ.</p>

<p>Only estimates can be given in reply to Questions 7, 10,
and 12.</p>

<p>If any question—as No. 17—is not applicable to you, this
sign—X—may be used.</p>

<p>A prompt reply will be considered as a special favor.</p>

<p><i>All personal information will be treated as confidential.</i> The
name is asked as a guarantee of good faith, to avoid sending
duplicates, and to render possible further correspondence in
regard to special points of experience. It may, however, be
omitted if desired.</p>

<p>The following circular letter was sent out in November,
1895, to the members of the Civic Club of Philadelphia:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging"><i>The Committee on Household Economics to the Members of the
Civic Club</i>:</p>

<p>The following standards of work and wages are submitted
by the Committee on Household Economics to the members of
the Civic Club for their consideration, with a view to taking
some action on the subject during the next season.</p>

<p>If any amendments or additions suggest themselves to the
members of the Club, will they please note them in the blank
space left for that purpose, and send the paper to the Chairman
of the Household Economics at the address given below?</p>

<p>In case an applicant for service fails to come up to these
standards, the employer agrees to furnish instruction in the
points of failure, the employee agreeing to share half the
expense of such instruction by accepting a corresponding
reduction of weekly wages until skill is attained. It is
understood, of course, that the employer furnishes the proper
materials and utensils for the performance of the labor.</p>

LUCY MAYNARD SALMON</p>

<p class="center">Press Comments on the First Edition</p>

<p>“This is an admirable analysis of the difficulties, advantages,
and disadvantages of domestic service, with illustrations and
statistics drawn from a careful investigation by the author and
from government reports. The book should be carefully studied
by all who believe that the family is the primary agency for social
reform and progress, and that public health and happiness wait
for the advancement of the industrial methods.”—<i>The
Dial</i> (Chicago).</p>

<p>“Lucy Maynard Salmon has made a scientific, and we think
a thorough, study of the perplexing problem so often called ‘the
servant question.’ The result is more than satisfactory, and if
her book ‘Domestic Service’ is read as widely as it deserves to
be read, there ought to be, in the near future, a far greater number
of happy housekeepers and contented servants than exist at
present.”—<i>Mail and Express</i> (New York).</p>

<p>“Intelligent women who are ambitious to excel in the management
of the home will find this volume interesting and helpful.”—<i>Home
Journal</i> (New York).</p>
